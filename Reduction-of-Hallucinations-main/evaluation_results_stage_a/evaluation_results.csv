6,"Blood test result showed a foreign object located but it could not be removed. A 31-year-old man was admitted to our hospital, complaining of hematochezia which had lasted for 1 month. His past history involved a high anterior resection of the rectum in our hospital due to intussusception caused by Peutz-Jeghers polyposis (Fig. ). He was hospitalized for 1 month after the procedure. Unfortunately, details of the surgical procedure that had been performed and the reason for his extended postoperative hospitalization were unknown, because clinical records from his previous admission were not available. He was followed up for 3 years after the procedure, during which he had no abdominal symptoms. He remained symptom-free until the month prior to readmission when he began to suffer from hematochezia. On this admission, hematochezia was his only symptom and there were no abnormal abdominal findings on physical examination. Blood test results, including levels of tumor markers, were all within normal limits. Colonoscopy revealed a hemorrhagic tumor with a smooth surface protruding from the anastomosis of the previous high anterior resection, at a distance of 10 cm from the anal verge; a second examination 4 days later revealed that the tumor had disappeared (Fig. ). The biopsied tumor and other small polyps were histologically diagnosed as adenocarcinoma and hamartomatous polyps, respectively (data not shown). We performed a low anterior resection of the rectum, including the anastomotic site with the adenocarcinoma, combined with a resection of the ileum for strong adhesion. The patient was discharged from our hospital 42 days after the operation.\nGross appearance of the resected rectum showed a defect of the rectal mucosa with a smooth edge and a mucosal bulge located at the anastomotic site (Fig. ). Cut surfaces demonstrated a submucosal tumor mainly occupying the proper muscle layer under the defect (Fig. ).

10,"The patient is admitted for non-ischemic cardiomyopathy. A 9-year-old male patient was evaluated at the endodontic clinic of the National University, School of Dentistry, Bogota, Colombia, on March 19, 2014. The patient had no prior medical or dental history. The trauma to his upper front teeth occurred 2 years previously (May 2012), and the initial autoradiogram revealed multiple root fractures at the level of teeth #11 and #21 (). One week after the first appointment, a flexible splint was placed between these 2 teeth, which remained present for approximately 7 months, based on the rationale that the teeth were very mobile and could be lost at any time. The parents were then informed that the prognosis of the case was poor and that extraction was recommended. They decided to request a second opinion (private practice); the splint was removed and endodontic treatment was started using intracanal medication, with calcium hydroxide paste placed on the fracture line in both teeth. This treatment was continued for approximately 1 year; however, the patient continued to have a sinus tract and pain in response to the percussion test, likely associated with necrosis of a coronal fragment, regardless of whether the apical fragment remained vital, which could be assumed due to the continuous apical growth of the teeth ( and ). Given the lack of positive response to treatment, the patient was referred to our endodontic clinic.\nThe first appointment occurred on March 19, 2014. The patient's clinical appearance can be seen in . Both teeth showed a mobility grade of 3, with no periodontal pockets or pain to horizontal or vertical percussion. Sinus tracts were present in both teeth. The pulp vitality, vertical percussion, and horizontal percussion tests were negative.\nRadiographically, multiple fracture lines were observed at the cervical and middle levels of the root, as well as an increase in the periodontal ligament space, a periradicular lesion, and inflammatory external root resorption. These clinical and radiographic findings confirmed the diagnosis of horizontal root fracture with chronic apical abscesses in teeth #11 and #21. Considering the poor prognosis for both teeth, an informed consent form was signed, and a revascularization treatment protocol was initiated using autologous PRP in tooth #11 and conventional revascularization treatment with a blood clot in tooth #21.\nLocal anesthesia was administered with the infiltration technique, using 2% lidocaine with 1:100,000 epinephrine, temporary cement was removed from both teeth, proper isolation and access to the root canals were ensured, and the working length of each tooth was extended up to the fracture line with an apex locator (Root ZX, Morita, Tokyo, Japan) and confirmed with a periapical radiograph (). Profuse irrigation was performed for each tooth with 10 mL of 1.25% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) using Endo-Eze Irrigator Tips (Ultradent Products Inc., South Jordan, Utah, USA) without instrumentation. After drying the canals with sterile paper points, a triple antibiotic paste consisting of amoxicillin (500 mg), metronidazole (500 mg), and ciprofloxacin (500 mg) (triturated and mixed in a 1:1:1 ratio with sterile water to obtain a paste-like consistency) was introduced into the canal using a 4 Lentulo Spiral 25 mm (Dentsply Maillefer, Tulsa, OK, USA). After condensing the paste on the orifice of the canal, the access cavity was temporarily restored with a glass ionomer (Ketac Molar Easymix; 3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA).\nThe patient remained asymptomatic, and the intraoral sinus drainage had disappeared. Therefore, we conducted the second part of the revascularization protocol. PRP was obtained by drawing blood from the patient into sterile tubes with 3.8% sodium citrate that were centrifuged for 10 minutes at a speed of 3,000 rpm in a standard laboratory centrifuge (ROTOFIX 32; Andreas Hettich GmbH & Co., Tuttlingen, Germany). Subsequently, in a laminar flow chamber, the obtained fractions were carefully separated with a 500 μL sterile pipette to isolate the PRP in the middle of the tube, distinct from the red blood cells at the bottom and the platelet-poor plasma at the top of the tube. The PRP obtained was then transferred to a 10 mL hypodermic syringe to be prepared for injection into the canal. Following local anesthesia (2% lidocaine without a vasoconstrictor), and rubber dam isolation, the root canals were accessed and irrigated with 5 mL of 5.25% NaOCl to remove the antibiotic paste and then irrigated with 5 mL of sterile saline solution. Both canals were dried with sterile paper points, and the final Irrigation was carried out with 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid for 1 minute in each tooth and then dried again []. We used a size 60 K-file to extend the working length until bleeding was achieved at the cementoenamel junction, and then waited for 20 minutes until hemostasis occurred and the fibrin clot stabilized. We only applied PRP on tooth #11, leaving the blood clot in place in tooth #21 with no further treatment (). Finally, the entrance of both canals was sealed with a 3-mm-thick layer of MTA Pro Root (Dentsply Maillefer) mixed according to the manufacturer's instructions. The MTA coronal barrier was sealed with a temporary filling glass ionomer (Ketac Molar Easymix; 3M ESPE). After completing the revascularization protocol, the patient was scheduled for periodic follow-ups. An autoradiogram at the end of this appointment was taken to verify the location of the coronal seal ().\nThis visit took place on June 27, 2014. An autoradiogram did not show any changes in relation to the initial autoradiogram (). Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) showed a seal with MTA in both upper central incisors. shows the axial view, shows the coronal view, shows the sagittal view of tooth #11 (PRP), and shows the sagittal view of tooth #21 (blood clot). The final restoration was performed with a composite (Filtek Z 250, 3M ESPE) at this time.\nThis appointment was on October 10, 2014. An autoradiogram showed apparent mineralization in the distal wall of the canal of tooth #11 (); unfortunately, no more autoradiograms were taken at that time to confirm the aforementioned mineralization. There were no symptoms or signs of inflammation, infection, or sinus tract. Cold tests were performed, and the patient reported a delayed stimulus in tooth #21.\nOn March 19, 2015, an autoradiogram of tooth #11 showed greater calcification in the root canal space and the fracture lines at the middle third (). There was no presence of periodontal pockets or sinus tracts. Cold tests gave a delayed response in teeth #11 and #21.\nOn April 20, 2017, periapical radiography was taken in the orthoradial position for teeth #11 and #21. This image demonstrated calcification of the canal space of tooth #11 (PRP-treated). Preservation of the crestal alveolar bone of both teeth and the process of healing with interposition of calcified tissue in the fracture line of tooth #21 were observed (). There were no periodontal pockets and no presence of sinus tracts. The response to the cold test was positive in tooth #11 and negative in tooth #21. A CBCT scan was taken, on which it was possible to clearly observe the seal with MTA and the calcification that had occurred in the root canal space of both the coronal () and the apical fragments of tooth #11 ( and ). In tooth #21, the apical fragment had been mineralized, and the coronal fragment still had a defined root canal space (), but there was no evidence of periapical pathology ().\nOn April 19, 2018, periapical radiography was taken in the orthoradial position (). The pattern of calcification into the root canal space of tooth #11 (PRP-treated) was still observed (), and it was also possible to see the displacement of the apical fragment of tooth #21 (). It is noteworthy that periodontal ligament formation was observed in the apical zone of the coronal fragment of tooth #21, as well as preservation of the level of the crestal alveolar bone of both teeth. The mobility of both teeth was grade 3. CBCT was again performed, showing that the calcification process continued in both fragments of tooth #11 (). In tooth #21, displacement of the apical fragment was confirmed (). Finally, at this follow-up there was no presence of periapical pathology in either tooth ().

13,"fgf signaling plays numerous roles during organogenesis of the embryonic gut tube. these results suggest that the liver and lungs are specified at progressively later times in development requiring mesoderm contact for different lengths of time. in addition to providing a foundation for further mechanistic studies on foregut organogenesis using the experimental advantages of the xenopus system, these data have implications for the directed differentiation of stem cells into foregut lineages. here we use xenopus embryos to examine the hypothesis that a prolonged duration of fgf signaling from the mesoderm is required to induce foregut organs. we show that both mesoderm and fgf signaling are required for liver and lung development in xenopus; formally demonstrating that this important step in organ induction is conserved with other vertebrate species. inhibition of fgf signaling results in enhanced liver and lung development, with a significant reduction of the pancreas/duodenum progenitor domain. hyper-activation of fgf signaling has the opposite effect expanding liver and lung gene expression and repressing pancreatic markers. mouse explant studies suggest that different thresholds of fgf signaling from the cardiogenic mesoderm induce lung, liver, and pancreas lineages from the ventral foregut progenitor cells. we show that fgf signaling is cell autonomously required in the endoderm and that a dominant negative fgf receptor decreases the ability of ventral foregut progenitor cells to contribute to the lung and liver buds. prolonged contact with the mesoderm and persistent fgf signaling through both mek and pi3k over an extended period of time are required for liver and lung specification. in the fibroblast growth factor signaling pathway, secreted ligands bind to transmembrane tyrosine kinase fgf receptors causing dimerization and activation of a number of intracellular signal transduction cascades including the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which phosphorylate erk and akt, respectively. fgf signals regulate cellular differentiation, proliferation, and survival in many contexts and studies in mice, chick, and zebrafish have shown that fgf mediated mesenchymal-epithelial interactions play numerous roles in the developing gut tube. during gastrulation, fgf signaling patterns the primitive gut tube by promoting posterior over anterior cell fate in the endoderm. then only hours later, fgf signals from the anterior lateral plate and cardiac mesoderm segregate the pancreas, liver, and lung lineages from a pool of ventral foregut progenitor cells. recent studies in zebrafish suggest that fgf signaling acts in part by restricting hepatic competence of the endoderm along the anterior-posterior axis. additionally, fgfs are important for the outgrowth and morphogenesis of many organ buds during fetal development; for instance mesenchymal fgf controls lung branching, pancreas proliferation and growth, stomach morphogenesis, and hepatopancreatic fate. considering these multiple context-dependent activities, it is likely that a better understanding of the precise temporal roles of fgf signaling during endoderm organogenesis will inform approaches to direct the differentiation of human stem cells in vitro. in this study we investigated the role that fgf signaling plays in the specification of foregut organs in xenopus embryos. in zebrafish and chick, fgf signals have been shown to be essential for hepatic specification. additionally, in vitro studies using mouse embryo foregut explant cultures from 0– somite-stages of development have suggested that fgf signals from the cardiac and lateral plate mesoderm regulate the induction of the pancreas, liver, and lungs in a dose-dependent manner. little or no fgf signaling is required for ventral endodermal explants from early somite-stage mouse embryos to turn on the pancreas marker pdx whereas explants cultured with cardiac mesoderm or recombinant fgf express the liver marker albumin and higher fgf doses stimulate expression of the thyroid/lung marker nkx. similar dose-responsive fgf effects have been observed during the differentiation of human es cells to foregut lineages. downstream of fgf receptor signaling, it has been shown that in mouse embryos the mek branch of the fgf pathway is necessary for liver albumin and alpha-fetoprotein expression, while the pi3k branch promotes hepatoblast proliferation. these data have led to a model of foregut organ development where different doses of fgf specify the different foregut lineages: very low or absent fgf levels are required for pancreas, intermediate fgf levels promote liver, and high fgf levels are required for lung. the mechanisms by which different thresholds of fgf are achieved in vivo are unknown, in part because mouse embryos are difficult to manipulate at these early stages in development. xenopus embryos have increasingly proven to be a valuable model to study the mechanisms of organogenesis. horb and slack have shown that signals from the mesoderm between stages nf to nf are required for xenopus endodermal explants to become regionally specified into anterior and posterior organ lineages. consistent with a conserved role for fgf signaling in xenopus foregut organ induction, multiple fgf ligands and receptors are expressed in the xenopus foregut mesenchyme and endoderm between stages nf15-42. moreover, fgf signaling is necessary for the induction of liver gene expression in cultured ectodermal explants in vitro and akt signaling is required for later pancreas and stomach progenitor cell survival. despite these suggestive data, the role of fgf signaling in xenopus foregut organ specification in vivo has not formally been determined. in this study, we show that: the pancreas, liver and lung are specified at progressively later times in xenopus development, and that the liver and lungs require progressively longer mesoderm contact; fgf signaling is required for lung and liver specification in vivo and this is, at least in part, a cell autonomous requirement in the endoderm; foregut endoderm in which fgf signaling is experimentally blocked appears to remain in a progenitor-like state; ectopic activation of the fgf pathway expands liver and lung development, and represses pancreatic fate; the high levels of fgf necessary for lung and liver induction appear to be achieved through fgf signaling over an extended period of time via both the mek and pi3k pathways. this temporal requirement for fgf signaling in foregut lineage segregation provides the foundation for future mechanistic studies in xenopus, and may impact studies aimed at inducing different foregut lineages from pluripotent stem cells. methods embryo manipulations xenopus laevis embryos were cultured as previously described. all animal experiments complied with the “animal research: reporting in vivo experiments” guidelines and were approved by the cincinnati children’s research foundation iacuc committee. for microdissection, ventral explants were dissected from embryos using eyelash blades and hair loops. at the indicated developmental time half of the explants had the mesoderm separated using hair loops in units/ml dispase for 10– min. endoderm explants were then cultured in xmbs to stage for analysis. synthetic rna for microinjection was transcribed using the mmessage kits and purified on microspin- columns. the following plasmids were used for mrna synthesis: prn gfp; pcs + β-gal; dnfgfr; cafgfr. embryos with clear dorsal-ventral pigment were selected for injections into the bottom of dorsal-vegetal blastomeres at the 4-8-cell stage to target large regions of the foregut mesendoderm and into the d cells at the 16-cell stage to target foregut endoderm avoiding the mesoderm. lineage labels were used to confirm the correct targeting. cell soluble inhibitors were dissolved in dmso and added to the media at the following working concentrations: pd, u, ly, and su. b/b homodimerizer was dissolved in 100% ethanol and used at μm working concentration. explants were cultured in ng/ml of human recombinant fgf in xmbs + %bsa. in situ hybridization in situ hybridizations were performed as previously described using the following probes: nr1h, pdx, ptf1α, nkx, tnni, foxf, gjb, hhex, nkx, hnf4α. image-j software was used to measure the average size of the hhex and pdx expression domains +/− s.d. in injected and control sibling embryos. immunostaining and western blot analysis for western blots, five embryos per sample were lysed in a tlb buffer with protease and phosphatase inhibitors each diluted 1:100: phosphatase inhibitor cocktail ii, phosstop, protease inhibitor cocktail. samples were run on a 10% polyacrylamide gel and transferred to an immobilon membrane. the membrane was incubated with the following antibodies: mouse anti-dperk1/, rabbit anti-erk, rabbit anti-pakt, and rabbit anti-akt and analyzed using the ecl plus system and a fujifilm las- luminescent analyzer. for immunofluorescence, xenopus embryos were fixed in memfa for h at rt, bisected with a razor blade, and stored in dent’s fixative. for confocal analysis, the embryo pieces were rehydrated though a methanol series, blocked with bbt for h and bbt with 5% serum for h, incubated with primary antibody overnight at 4°, washed in pbs %triton, incubated with secondary antibody overnight at 4°, washed again, dehydrated in methanol, then cleared with a benzyl benzoate and benzyl alcohol mix. for immunofluorescence, the following antibodies were used, primary: rabbit anti-dperk1/, mouse anti-gfp, rabbit anti-phospho-histone h, and rabbit anti-active-caspase; and secondary antibodies: anti-rabbit-cy, anti-mouse-cy or goat anti-rabbit-ap. pancreas, liver, and lung are specified at progressively later times in development through prolonged interactions with cardiac-lateral plate mesoderm as a first step in characterizing the potential role of fgfs in xenopus foregut organ induction we carefully examined when during development different foregut lineages were specified. horb and slack have previously demonstrated in xenopus that mesodermal signals between stages nf to nf are required in order for the endoderm to become regionally specified and express pancreas, liver, and intestinal markers at stage nf42. in order to determine whether distinct lineages are specified at different times, we performed a series of microdissection experiments isolating ventral explants and removing the ventral cardiac/lateral plate mesoderm from the endoderm at different times in development. explants were cultured until stage nf and analyzed by in situ hybridization for expression of early lineage markers of the pancreas, liver and lung/thyroid. as controls to verify effective separation of the endoderm from mesoderm tissue, we examined the expression of the pan-endodermal marker gjb, the lateral plate mesoderm marker foxf, and the cardiac mesoderm marker tnni. these controls demonstrated that our method of removing the mesoderm by dispase treatment and manual pealing off the tissue with hairloops effectively produced endoderm explants without foxf1+ and tnni3+ mesoderm. these experiments showed that the expression of early pancreas, liver, or lung markers in the endoderm required mesoderm contact for different periods of time. interestingly, we observed the pancreas-duodenum marker pdx was expressed in explants >75% of the time regardless of when the mesoderm was removed between stages nf16-. we obtained similar results with another pancreas marker ptf1a, suggesting that as early as stage nf the endoderm has received sufficient signals to activate expression of pancreatic progenitor markers by stage nf in contrast, expression of the lung and liver markers required longer durations of mesodermal contact. expression of the liver marker nr1h required mesoderm contact until stages nf25- after which point the mesoderm was no longer required. in contrast, nkx expression was not induced in endoderm explants unless mesoderm was kept in contact throughout stage nf. in explants cultured with mesoderm through stage nf the nkx + tissue was observed in two discreet domains immediately dorsal-posterior to the heart, indicative of lung tissue. we conclude that the pancreas, liver, and lungs are specified at progressively later times in development in a caudal-to-rostral progression along the a-p axis. the most caudal tissue the pancreas is specified first, followed by liver, which requires mesoderm contact until nf and then the most rostral organ the lung is specified last requiring mesoderm contact up to nf fgf signaling is active in the xenopus foregut endoderm during organ induction our tissue separation experiments show that complete organ induction requires mesodermal contact between stages nf16- a survey of the literature indicates that many fgf ligands and receptors are expressed in the xenopus foregut region during this time in development. to investigate if and when the xenopus ventral foregut endoderm is responding to fgf signaling we examined di-phosphorylated erk1/ immunostaining as a read-out of active fgf/mek signaling. in the gastrula embryo, perk was not detected in the endoderm and was restricted to the involuting mesoderm, as previously described. we first detected a low level of perk in the anterior mesendoderm at stage nf as it migrates to its final position in the ventral foregut. between stages nf19- robust perk was present in the ventral foregut progenitors and in the adjacent cardiac and lateral plate mesoderm. by stage nf when lung and liver specification markers begin to be expressed perk is detected in the thickening hepatic epithelium and the nascent lung buds, as well as in the heart and lateral plate mesoderm. in stage nf gut tubes, we detected perk in the liver and pancreatic buds, stomach, and the distal tips of the lung buds consistent with a role for fgf signaling during organ bud outgrowth. this data reveals that between stages nf15- the period when mesoderm is required for liver and lung specification, the endoderm is experiencing active perk signaling. fgf signaling induces lung and liver, and represses early pancreas fate multiple fgf ligands and receptors are expressed in the xenopus foregut during organ induction. in order to inhibit all fgf signaling in the foregut endoderm, we cultured embryos from stage nf to nf with a small molecule inhibitor pd, which blocks fgf receptor activity and analyzed them for mature liver, pancreas, lung, and heart markers. western blot analysis confirmed that fgfri treatment dramatically reduced fgf/perk and fgf/pakt activity and blocked expression of the fgf target gene spry. fgfri treatment resulted in a dramatic reduction or complete loss of liver and lung marker expression. we did not observe any obvious impact on nkx expression in the thyroid region. this fgf requirement in lung development is similar to that recently described by wang et al.. in contrast, expression of the early pancreas marker ptf1α was only reduced in 37% of the fgf-inhibited embryos, suggesting that pancreas specification requires little if any fgf signaling during these stages. treatment with a second independent fgf receptor inhibitor su or injection of rna encoding a dominant negative fgf receptor into the presumptive foregut mesendoderm at the 4– cell stage caused a similar loss of liver and lung gene expression at stage nf with little if any impact on the pancreas gene expression relative to controls. to test whether fgf signaling was sufficient to induce lung and liver fate we cultured foregut endoderm explants lacking mesoderm with recombinant fgf but this was not sufficient to induce nr1h or nkx expression. this suggests that other mesodermal signals in additional to fgfs are also required, the most likely candidate being bmps, which we have recently shown is also required to maintain foregut progenitors. to overcome this complication, we injected the presumptive foregut mesendoderm with a drug inducible fgfr construct. when injected embryos were treated from stage nf to nf with the drug “b/b-homodimerizer” this causes receptor clustering and ligand-independent fgfr signaling as measured by increased perk levels. activation of the cafgfr caused an expansion of liver and lung expression domains in 30% and 75% of the embryos respectively. in contrast, the pancreas marker ptf1α was reduced or absent in 86% of the activated cafgfr embryos. we next wanted to determine what became of the presumptive liver and lung foregut endoderm when fgf signaling was blocked. one possibility was that it adopted a more posterior fate, but analysis of fgfri embryos with intestinal markers indicated that this was not the case. we next tested whether fgf signaling was required to maintain early foregut progenitor identity prior to lineage segregation. we therefore examined the expression of hhex, which is initially expressed throughout the foregut endoderm, but then becomes restricted to the liver and thyroid as organ induction proceeds. however, in embryos treated with the fgfri from stage nf to nf or embryos injected with dnfgfr rna we found that hhex expression was largely unaffected at stage nf, indicating that fgf signaling is not required to maintain the foregut progenitors at this stage. in addition when we examined hhex expression in embryos treated with fgfri from nf18-35; hhex was still present in most embryos, although the size of the expression domain was significantly reduced. this result was in contrast to the liver specification marker nr1h which was absent in most fgfri embryos, suggesting that when fgf signaling is inhibited the foregut cells are blocked in a progenitor-like state. we also closely examined pdx expression because mouse explant experiments suggest that in the absence of cardiac mesoderm or absence of fgf, the foregut adopts a pdx1+ pancreatic/duodenal fate rather than liver fate. in xenopus pdx is expressed in the pancreatic/duodenal progenitors prior to the expression of ptf1a. fgfri treatment caused a modest, but significant expansion in the size of the pdx1+ expression domain. examination of hhex and pdx in embryos where fgf signaling was ectopically activated by the cafgfr revealed the opposite phenotype with a significant expansion of hhex and a reduced or absent pdx expression domain. together these results indicate that fgf signaling is required for hepatic specification from hhex + progenitors. the data further suggests that similar to what has been reported in mice, fgf regulates the choice of xenopus endoderm progenitors cells to adopt liver versus pancreas fates. fgf signaling is required autonomously in the endoderm the xenopus lateral plate and pre-cardiac mesoderm is also patterned by fgf signaling. since the cardiac mesoderm, in particular, is implicated in foregut organ induction it was possible that the effects on endoderm gene expression we observed in fgf-inhibited embryos were secondary to mesodermal changes. we therefore examined the expression of the cardiac progenitor marker nkx at stage nf and the myocardial differentiation marker tnni at stage nf although nkx and tnni expression were reduced in approximately 50% of fgf-inhibited embryos, both heart markers were almost always present. this suggested that impaired cardiac development was unlikely to completely explain the loss of liver and lungs. to directly test the cell-autonomous need for fgf signaling in foregut endoderm progenitors, we injected rna encoding gfp along with dnfgfr or β-galactosidase rna into the d blastomeres at the 16-cell stage, which targets the rna to the foregut endoderm, and avoids the mesoderm. injection of the dnfgfr into the mesoderm frequently causes gastrulation defects and we observed this in about 50% of our 4-cell stage injections in figure in contrast the foregut-targeted embryos gastrulated normally and the lineage label showed that the anterior mesendoderm migrated correctly to the ventral foregut position. immunostaining of injected embryos confirmed that dnfgfr/gfp expressing cells lack robust perk activity at stage nf. we then scored isolated gut tubes at stage nf to determine which tissues the lineage labeled cells had contributed. the most severe phenotype in these experiments was a complete loss of all discernable foregut organ buds, which never occurred in controls; consistent with foregut endoderm requiring fgf signaling to induce organ lineages. in gut tubes with mosaic expression of labeled cells, we found that control β-gal/gfp cells contributed to the liver in 28% and the lung in approximately 30% of embryos, whereas dnfgfr/gfp-expressing cells only contributed to the liver in 11% and the lung in 5% of embryos. importantly, gfp positive cells were not detected in the cardiac mesoderm, verifying that the rna was specifically targeted to the endoderm. this excludes the possibility that the defects in liver and lung contribution were only secondary to cardiac defects and demonstrates a cell-autonomous requirement for fgf signaling in the endoderm. there was little difference in contribution of control βgal or dnfgfr expressing cells to the intestine, pancreatic buds, or stomach, suggesting that robust fgf signaling is not required for cells to populate these tissues. we conclude that ventral foregut endoderm progenitors that cannot receive an fgf signal are less likely to contribute to lung and liver buds. prolonged fgf signaling is required for lung and liver induction in vitro mouse explant experiments using high doses of recombinant fgf signaling induce nkx expressing lung tissue, whereas moderate doses of fgf induce liver-specific gene expression. to test whether xenopus liver and lung fate exhibit a similar dose-dependent need for fgf signaling in vivo we treated embryos with different concentrations of the fgfri from stages nf to nf this resulted in the expected dose-dependent reduction in endogenous perk. however, both liver and lung genes exhibited a similar dose responsive reduction in expression, suggesting that the level of fgfr activity per se does not regulate lung versus liver fate in xenopus. we therefore considered the alternative hypothesis that fgf signaling might induce the liver and lungs at different times in development. to test these temporal requirements for fgf signaling, we treated embryos for different time periods with the fgf receptor inhibitor and scored liver and lung specification at stage nf. we found that inhibition of fgf signaling for shorter periods of time all resulted in a reduction in liver and lung marker expression, which was less dramatic than when fgf signaling was inhibited for the entire nf18- period. we noticed that the level of reduction in nkx -expressing lung tissue was similar in the various intermediate treatments, whereas the reduction in liver gene expression was more dramatic at earlier time points. these results are consistent with the tissue separation experiments, which indicate that the liver is specified earlier than the lung. cardiac tnni expression was mildly reduced across fgf inhibition treatments, with the long and early periods showing the most effects. these data suggest that prolonged fgf signaling throughout the organ induction period is necessary to specify both liver and lung, and that lung fate requires the longest duration of active fgf signaling. pi3k and mek branches both contribute to lung and liver development there is evidence from mouse foregut explants that different branches of fgf signaling play distinct roles in foregut development, with mek being required for liver gene expression whist the pi3k branch regulates proliferation. to determine if a distinct fgf signaling pathways were required for foregut lineages in xenopus, we cultured the embryos in either ly or u from stage nf to nf and analyzed the foregut organ lineage markers. western blot analysis confirmed that pi3k inhibition resulted in a significant decrease in phospho-akt, whereas mek1/ inhibition resulted in a significant decrease in perk compared to vehicle treated controls. pi3ki and meki treatments caused reduced or absent liver expression in 62% or 34% of the embryos respectively, which was not as dramatic as the reductions caused by fgfri treatment, suggesting that both the pi3k and mek branches are both involved in xenopus hepatic induction. nkx expression was reduced or absent in 83% of pi3ki embryos, similar to fgfri, but in only 45% of meki embryos, suggesting prolonged pi3k activity is particularly important in lung specification. if we removed the fgfri at nf and isolated embryonic gut tubes at stage nf 46% of the lung and 75% of the liver buds were dramatically reduced in size, while the pancreas, stomach, and intestine were largely unaffected. in comparison, the pi3ki or meki treatments only caused modest reductions in foregut organ bud size at nf which were not as dramatic as those seen with the fgfri. we also tested whether pi3k or mek were required at different times in development by treating embryos for shorter time periods. similar to the results with the fgfri, treatment with either meki or pi3ki for a variety of shorter durations between stage nf18- all resulted in a modest reduction in lung and liver gene expression which was less severe than the fgfri treatment over the similar period; and caused little change in pancreas specification consistent with the fgfri data. this data suggests there is not a specific time when the pi3k or mek branches act, but support a duration model where both branches are necessary over a prolonged period. for comparison. the fact that pi3ki and meki both resulted in moderate phenotypes less severe than fgfri treatment suggests that pi3k and mek branches act in parallel. to directly test the dual need for pi3k and mek signaling, we treated embryos with both inhibitors and observed a dramatic loss of liver and lung markers similar to fgfri treatment. additionally, although many meki + pi3ki embryos died by stage nf some remaining embryos exhibited severe foregut organ agenesis. treatment with pi3ki, meki, or meki + pi3ki did not disrupt expression of hhex or pdx in the embryos at stage nf, with the exception of a modest decrease in the hhex expression area in pi3ki treated embryos similar to fgfri. the observation that combined mek + pi3ki treatment did not expand pdx expression like the fgfri embryos suggests either that another pathway downstream of fgfr represses pancreatic fate, and/or that pi3k and mek have additional fgf-independent pro-pancreatic roles in the foregut. we therefore examined the impact that fgf, pi3k, and mek inhibition had on proliferation and cell death. embryos treated with fgfri, pi3ki, or meki did not exhibit significantly changed foregut cell proliferation at stages nf or nf relative to vehicle treated controls as measured by phospho-histone h. however, at stage nf when organ buds undergo extensive outgrowth, fgfri and pi3ki embryos exhibited a significant decrease in foregut cell proliferation. analysis of apoptosis by activated caspase- immunostaining demonstrated that pi3ki treatment increased foregut endoderm cell death at stage nf and nf. the fact that pi3ki causes increased cell death, whereas the fgfri did not supports the idea that additional fgf-independent pi3k-mediated signaling pathway promote foregut cell survival. we conclude that both the pi3k and mek branches of fgf signaling contribute to lung and liver specification in xenopus with the pi3k branch being particularly important for lung. in addition fgfr and pi3k regulate organ bud proliferation with fgf-independent pi3k activity also promoting xenopus foregut cell survival. discussion the role of fgf signaling in xenopus foregut organ development has not been systematically examined to date. in this study we show that: the pancreas, liver and lung are specified at progressively later times in development and that the liver and lung require progressively longer mesodermal contact between stages nf16-35; activated perk, indicative of fgf signaling, is detected in the developing foregut endoderm throughout this period of development; prolonged fgf signaling via both the mek and pi3k pathways is required for xenopus lung and liver specification in vivo and this is at least in part a cell autonomous requirement in the endoderm; fgf signaling regulates the allocation of hhex + liver progenitors versus pdx1+ pancreatic/duodenum progenitors. horb and slack have previously shown that contact with the mesoderm between stages nf15- was essential for the endoderm to express liver and pancreas genes at stage nf42. our work extends this study by examining if different lineages are specified at different time points during development and tests the role of fgf signaling in this process. our data show that the liver and lung lineages are specified at progressively later times in development, requiring mesodermal contact for increasingly longer times. the critical period of mesodermal contact between stages nf16- correlates with the presence of perk in the foregut endoderm and the necessity for prolonged fgf signaling for the expression of liver and lung, but not pancreas, specification markers. we demonstrated that specification of liver and lung lineages requires mesoderm contact from stages nf16- and nf16- respectively. interestingly, we found that as early as stage nf16- endoderm explants without mesoderm were able to express pancreatic markers pdx and ptf1a at stage this result contrasts with those of horb and slack who found that the mesoderm was required between stages nf25- for anterior endoderm to express pdx at stage nf when organ buds begin to form. this suggests that although we detect pdx expression in endoderm explants cultured without mesoderm at stage nf pancreatic fate might not yet be stably committed; thus mesodermal contact could be required through stage nf to maintain later pancreatic gene expression. this is consistent with the role of fgf/pi3k-mediated signaling promoting proliferation of a pdx1+ cell population. our data suggest that the prolonged requirement for the mesoderm in liver and lung specification can, at least in part, be accounted for by prolonged fgf signaling. together with the recent report by drysdale and colleagues who similarly found that fgf signaling was required for xenopus lung development, our data demonstrate that the critical role for fgf signaling in liver and lung is highly conserved in vertebrates. our results are consistent with findings from chick and mouse explant cultures showing that mesodermal contact and fgf signaling are required for the specification of liver and lung. in addition, although the lateral plate mesoderm is clearly patterned by fgfs, our results targeting the dnfgfr to the foregut endoderm demonstrates a cell autonomous requirement for active fgf signaling in liver and lung development similar to endoderm-specific transgenic analysis in mice. it is worth noting that while the molecular pathways are conserved between different species the relative timing of lineage specification is somewhat different. we show that liver and lung fate is specified in xenopus between the 30– somite stages, which is similar to zebrafish at 26– ss; however in mouse and chick these fates are specified between the 7– ss. we speculate that these differences could be influenced in part by the relatively early heart development in amniotes. in vitro mouse foregut explants studies suggest that different doses of fgf segregate the foregut endoderm into pancreas, liver and lung lineages with little or no fgf being required for pancreas, intermediate fgf doses promoting liver and high fgf concentration promoting lung fate in the foregut explants. similarly hhex expression in hepatoblasts is fgf-dependent in zebrafish embryos and chick explants. our results are in general agreement with these studies; we also found that fgf signaling promoted liver and lung and repressed pancreas. however we did not find any evidence supporting a dose requirement for liver versus lung induction in xenopus, although we cannot totally rule out this mechanism. we also did not find discrete short periods in development when liver versus lung fate was induced. rather our data support a duration model where prolonged fgf signaling is required to specify both liver and lung lineages, with the lung seeming to require a longer duration of fgf activity. different durations of fgf signaling are important in the development of other systems as well, for instance, in lens epithelial cells it has been shown that low doses of fgf signaling promote proliferation while high doses of fgf promote fiber differentiation. we also postulate that the spatial requirement for fgf signaling in vivo is also likely to be important factor in regulating the duration of exposure to a fgf signal. we observed that in some fgf inhibited embryos the residual liver gene expression was immediately next to the cardiac mesoderm, suggesting liver gene expression was only induced in the cells closest to a source of fgf. it is important to point out that our experiments do not formally demonstrate that the mesoderm alone is the source of the fgf ligands; evidence from chick and xenopus embryos shows the endoderm also expresses fgf ligands and thus autocrine signaling within the endoderm could be involved. our data indicate that both the mek and pi3k branches of the fgf response contribute to lung and liver induction. inhibition of either branch resulted in intermediate phenotypes compared to fgfri, while combining meki and pi3ki caused a dramatic loss of mature liver and lung markers recapitulating the fgfri treatment. our data also indicate that the pi3k activity is important for cell survival and proliferation, and some of this activity appears to be fgf-independent, consistent with a report that pakt signaling has an anti-apoptotic role in xenopus stomach/pancreas development. our in vivo findings that both mek and pi3k are involved in liver and lung specification differ somewhat from explant studies of the mouse liver, where the mek branch is important for hepatic gene expression while the pi3k branch is important for explant growth. we demonstrated that specification of liver and lung lineages requires mesoderm contact from stages nf16- and nf16- respectively and while our data suggest that prolonged fgf signaling accounts for this in part, it is likely that additional signals also differentially promote these lineages at later stages. indeed bmp, wnt and retinoic acid are also required for foregut organogenesis and these probably interact with the fgf pathway. recent examples of such signaling cross talk have come from studies in zebrafish suggest that fgf signaling acts along the anterior-posterior axis to restrict the competence of the endoderm to respond to hepatic-inducing wnt signals. consistent with other signaling factors acting in concert with fgfs, we found that exogenous fgf was not sufficient to support liver or lung fate in foregut explants lacking mesoderm, whereas in vivo, and presumably in the presence of other signals, activated cafgfr was sufficient to expand liver and lung at the expense of pancreas. this suggests either that different fgf ligands are specifically required for liver and lung induction and/or that other mesodermal signals are required to potentiate the inducing activity of fgf candidates for additional signals include bmps. it is also possible that the mesoderm provides important cell-cell or cell-ecm contacts that might be necessary to support foregut organ cell fate. indeed, we have recently shown that fibronectin-dependent bmp signaling is required to maintain foregut progenitors. in the future it will be important to better understand the mechanisms by which the fgf pathway interacts with other pathways during foregut organogenesis. the xenopus embryo is increasingly being used to study the development of endoderm derived organs, but the molecular basis foregut lineage specification is poorly understood. we demonstrate that the liver and lung lineages are specified at progressively later times in development requiring progressively longer mesoderm contact between stages nf15- we show that fgf signaling is active in the foregut endoderm at this time and that lung and liver induction requires prolonged fgf signaling through both the mek and pi3k transduction pathways. we conclude that fgf-mediated foregut organ development in xenopus is highly conserved with that described in mammals. moreover our results highlight a previously unappreciated role for the temporal regulation of signaling during organ induction, which may impact strategies to direct the differentiation of stem cells. abbreviations fgf: fibroblast

The initial histologic diagnosis of the skin biopsy was EMPD. The preoperative instrumental investigations showed no evidence of recurrence on the previous surgical site or other underlying internal malignancy. The patient underwent a mapping biopsy at multiple sites to accurately establish the boundary of the lesion, followed by wide excision and closure of the defect with a skin graft.\nThe resected perineum and penile shaft showed ill-defined indurated nodules with a firm consistency. The lesion in the overlying epidermis measured 6 cm, with a 1.5-cm-sized mass in the dermis. The cut surface was solid and gray-white with focal mucinous appearance. On histologic examination, the lowpower view showed a relatively well-defined mass occupying the dermis and subcutis (). The overlying epidermis showed irregular epidermal hyperplasia containing scattered large cells arranged singly or in groups, as in the previous skin biopsy, suggesting an epidermal pagetoid spread of underlying tumor cells (). The tumor showed two composite features in which solid nests of poorly differentiated carcinoma were juxtaposed with paucicellular mucinous lakes with floating tumor cell clusters (). The latter accounted for the majority of the tumor, about 70%, and the rest consisted of poorly differentiated components. Tumor cells in both the mucinous pool and more cellular area revealed the same histological features of abundant eosinophilic cytoplasm and large vesicular nuclei with frequent mitoses up to 7/10 high power field (, ). In situ lesions similar to ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast were also observed () with colonization of the hair follicles (). Overall histology suggested a mucinous carcinoma with minor poorly differentiated components.\nHistological differential diagnosis included PCMC and late metastasis of the previously diagnosed colon cancer. Histologic review of the patient’s previous colon cancer showed a 4.3-cm moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma with the assigned stage of T3N0M0. The tumor consisted of well-formed or cribriform patterns of tumor glands with frequently observed dirty necrosis (). There was no mucin production observed in the skin lesion.\nImmunohistochemical studies were performed. The Paget’s and dermal tumor cells of the skin lesion were positive for cytokeratin (CK) 7, CK20, gross cystic disease fluid protein-15 (GCDFP-15) (–), and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), but negative for caudal-related homeobox gene 2 (CDX-2). On the other hand, tumor cells of the colon cancer were positive for CK20, CDX-2, CEA, but not gross cystic disease fluid protein 15 or CK7. Additional staining of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 and estrogen receptor (ER) was observed in the skin lesion (, ), but the lesion was negative for progesterone receptor (PR). Myoepithelial cells surrounding the carcinoma in situ were highlighted by CK5/6 immunostaining (). The overall immunohistochemical findings of the skin lesion were different from those of colon cancer but similar to those of breast cancer, but similar to those of breast cancer, indicating sweat gland origin. On the basis of these histologic and immunohistochemical findings, the two malignancies were considered to differ in origin, and the present case was a primary mucinous carcinoma of the skin.\nAnother challenge was to determine whether the minor poorly differentiated components were eccrine or apocrine in origin because there was no clear distinction in histologic and immunohistochemical features. We concluded apocrine differentiation of the lesion due to the location in the groin, where apocrine glands are many in number, and to the resemblance of apocrine carcinoma in the breast even though decapitation secretion was absent. In addition, close approximation and colonization of the hair follicle () favored the origin of the follicularapocrine unit.\nThe final pathologic diagnosis was PCMC with EMPD showing apocrine differentiation.\nThis case was approved by the institutional review board (IRB) of Kosin University Gospel Hospital, and informed consent was waived by the IRB (IRB reference number: 2017-10-010).

21,"repeated adaptive radiations are evident when phenotypic divergence occurs within lineages, but this divergence into different forms is convergent when compared across lineages. classic examples of such repeated adaptive divergence occur in island and lake systems. host-parasite systems in many respects are analogous to island systems, where host species represent isolated islands for parasites whose life cycle is highly tied to that of their hosts. thus, host-parasite systems might exhibit interesting cases of repeated adaptive divergence as seen in island and lake systems. the feather lice of birds spend their entire life cycle on the body of the host and occupy distinct microhabitats on the host: head, wing, body and generalist. these microhabitat specialists show pronounced morphological differences corresponding to how they escape from host preening. we tested whether these different microhabitat specialists were a case of repeated adaptive divergence by constructing both morphological and molecular phylogenies for a diversity of avian feather lice, including many examples of head, wing, body and generalist forms. morphological and molecular based phylogenies were highly incongruent, which could be explained by rampant convergence in morphology related to microhabitat specialization on the host. in many cases lice from different microhabitat specializations, but from the same group of birds, were sister taxa. this pattern indicates a process of repeated adaptive divergence of these parasites within host group, but convergence when comparing parasites across host groups. these results suggest that host-parasite systems are unlikely to be a case in which repeated adaptive radiations are relatively common, and morphological convergence actually clarifies evolutionary relationships. adaptive radiationconvergencephthirapteraectoparasitesphylogenetics adaptive radiations are believed to be responsible for the diversification of many groups of organisms. one common feature of groups that have diversified by an adaptive radiation is divergence of morphological features with ecological function. in any adaptive radiation, there are two broad patterns by which lineages could diversify. on the one extreme, the adaptive morphological traits of the radiation could evolve early on in the diversification process and lineages possessing these features could then radiate in ""open niches."" alternatively, divergence in morphology may be repeated and ongoing during the entire diversification process through processes of character displacement. in the case of some adaptive radiations where there is repeated morphological diversification, this divergence in morphology may also be convergent. that is, different clades of the adaptive radiation converge on similar solutions to common ecological problems. several examples of potential repeated adaptive radiations have been identified, including benthic and limnetic sticklebacks, ecomorphs of hawaiian tetragnatha spiders, african rift lake cichlid fishes and bonin island land snails. a particularly well-documented example is the anolis lizards on large caribbean islands, which have diversified into a number of ecomorphs related to the microhabitats in which different species occur. however, when compared across different islands, these ecomorphs are convergent. that is, similar selection pressures on different islands have resulted in similarities in the type of radiations that have occurred. such convergence suggests there might be a limited number of ""niches"" into which lineages can diversify. in contrast, morphological or behavioral traits under more limited ecological selection, for example, sexually selected traits, might be more likely to diversify into a broader array of forms and show less propensity for convergence. it is unclear how common such repeated adaptive divergence processes are across the array of adaptive radiations in nature. because convergent evolution leads to broad similarity in morphological features, classifications and phylogenies based mainly on morphology make identification of such convergence in a single group more difficult. by reconstructing the evolution of various ecomorphs or niche specialists over an independent phylogenetic tree, it is possible to identify the relative contributions of early versus repeated morphological divergence. in the former case, morphological characters should be highly concordant with the phylogeny, while in the latter, considerable homoplasy in morphological characters related to the adaptive features should be observed. in general, losos suggests replicate adaptive radiations are relatively rare, and typically confined to island or lake systems, perhaps because environments are discrete, isolated and replicated across space. host-parasite systems have been compared as analogous to island systems, and might prove to be another case where repeated adaptive divergence is relatively more frequent. one group that has undergone an extensive adaptive radiation is the feather lice of birds. feather lice are wingless ectoparasites that consume the downy portions of the feathers, and thus do not interact with the host's immune system. these lice have radiated across the diversity of birds into over species in around genera, with pronounced morphological variation. the main way that birds control these ectoparasites is through preening. feather lice have a limited number of options to escape this preening defense behavior, and these escape behaviors are highly correlated with louse morphology, suggesting strong selection on louse morphology for escape. feather lice generally follow one of four escape mechanisms corresponding to the main regions of the hosts body in which these escape mechanisms are used: wing lice, body lice, head lice and generalists. avian wing lice have a long and slender body form and escape from host preening by inserting themselves between the feather barbs of the primary wing feathers. the size of wing lice is strongly correlated with the space between these feather barbs. body lice use more active escape mechanisms by burrowing in the downy portions of the body feathers or dropping from feather to feather. these lice have a characteristic short, rounded body form with a rounded head margin. head lice escape from host preening defenses by remaining on the head where birds cannot preen with their bills. the fact that these lice remain on the head to escape preening is also supported by the fact that these lice are not cryptically colored on birds that have cryptically colored wing and body lice. head lice have a rounded body form and a triangular head margin. these lice have a rostral groove on the head through which they insert a feather barb, gripping it with their mandibles. this likely allows them to resist being removed from the bird by scratching, which is the main defense of birds against head lice. finally, lice that are generalists can be found over most of the bird's body, wings and sometimes head, and likely escape preening by running through the feathers. these lice have an intermediate body shape and typically a rounded head margin. although there is some behavioral plasticity in the lice of these different forms, such that sometimes lice of one microhabitat preference are found on other parts of the host's body, the strong correlation of overall morphological body form with these microhabitat preferences is pronounced. many groups of birds are host to more than one type of microhabitat specialist louse. genera of ischnoceran feather lice often correspond to lice of a single microhabitat specialization on an order of family of birds. thus the radiation of feather lice relates to both the radiation across different host groups and radiation into different microhabitats for escaping host preening defenses. here we evaluate the pattern of diversification of this adaptive radiation. the central question is what are the relative contributions of 1) early microhabitat specialization and subsequent radiation across birds versus 2) repeated adaptive divergence of microhabitat specialists within major groups of birds? we do this by reconstructing phylogenetic trees based on both molecular and morphological data sets, evaluating the level of congruence of these trees, and reconstructing microhabitat specialization over them. in particular, using randomizations, we evaluate the degree of signal contained in microhabitat specialization and host group over both the molecular and morphological trees. we evaluate the pattern of repeated adaptive divergence over each tree by determining the number of times parasites from the same host group, but of different microhabitat specializations, are sister taxa and compare this value to that expected by chance. maximum likelihood analysis of the molecular data produced a single most likely tree for avian feather lice, and the bayesian gene-partitioned analysis recovered a tree topology that was identical. in general, bootstrap analyses revealed relatively high support for many branches, particularly more terminal branches. bayesian posterior probabilities were also high, with of branches being supported by more the 90% posterior probability. in many aspects the topology of this tree agrees with previous molecular based studies of lice, and differences involve only weakly supported nodes in these prior studies. parsimony analysis of the morphological data resulted in six most parsimonious trees. these trees differed substantially from the molecular based tree as can be seen by principal coordinate analysis of their partition metric scores. six trees resulted from combined parsimony analysis of both the molecular and morphological datasets. the consensus of these trees was more resolved than the consensus of the morphological trees, and analysis of partition metrics indicated these trees were intermediate between the molecular and morphological trees, but most closely resembling the molecular tree, likely because of the larger number of molecular characters and generally weaker support for the morphological tree. the sh-test indicated that, using the molecular dataset, both the morphological tree and a tree in which each microhabitat specialization was constrained to be monophyletic were significantly less likely. when microhabitat specialization was reconstructed over the molecular tree there were changes in microhabitat specialization, which was only slightly fewer than that expected by chance according to the maddison and slatkin test. these randomizations suggested that over the molecular tree, microhabitat specialization is only weakly correlated with the phylogeny. in contrast, reconstructing microhabitat specialization over the six most parsimonious morphological trees required only or steps, and randomizations indicated microhabitat specialization was highly correlated with the tree produced by the morphological dataset. these randomizations suggest that over the morphological trees, microhabitat specialization was strongly correlated with the phylogeny. reconstructions of host group over the molecular tree required steps and these were significantly fewer than expected by chance with the maddison and slatkin test. reconstruction of host group over all six morphological trees resulted in more steps than for over the molecular tree, and this larger number of steps was not fewer than expected by chance. these results indicate that over the molecular tree, host group is strongly correlated with the phylogeny, while over the morphological tree it is not. in the molecular tree there were seven cases where species of lice of different microhabitat specializations, but from the same host group, were terminal sister taxa. compared to a distribution based on randomized trees, this number was many more than would be expected by chance. the maximum possible number for our dataset would be pairs. for the morphological trees, it was never observed that lice from different microhabitat specializations, but from the same host group, were sister taxa, and this was well within the distribution of random trees. discussion phylogenetic analyses based on one mitochondrial and two nuclear genes for avian feather lice revealed a pattern of repeated adaptive divergence of microhabitat specialization in these ectoparasites. although there were some groups of genera possessing a particular microhabitat specialization, there was little indication of strong phylogenetic conservation in this trait. rather, lice parasitizing the same group of hosts tended to diverge in their microhabitat specialization in a repeated pattern over the tree. the number of divergence events within host groups was many more than expected by chance revealing a pronounced pattern of repeated divergence of this trait within host groups and broad scale convergence across the radiation of feather lice. trees resulting from analysis of morphological data produced a dramatically different pattern, suggesting that most morphological characters are likely to be correlated with microhabitat specialization. this convergence likely obscures the true pattern of evolutionary relationships when inferred from morphology alone. in particular, microhabitat specialization was highly correlated with the morphological tree. based on the molecular tree, microhabitat specialization is highly convergent, and this convergence also extends to gross morphological features. thus, selection for general morphological shape may affect a suite of morphological characters correlated with that shape. considering host group, the molecular tree shows much more conservation in host group usage than the morphological tree. this observation suggests that divergence in microhabitat and morphology occurs on lice within a group of hosts. it is currently unclear precisely how this divergence may be occurring. one possibility would be a form of sympatric speciation, whereby lice that live in different microhabitats on a host preferentially mate with other lice in those habitats. this would potentially reinforce character divergence associated with different selection pressures in different microhabitats. however, given that lice from different microhabitats often move to the same part of the host to feed, such a scenario may be unlikely. another possibility is that this divergence is facilitated by host switching events and associated behavioral plasticity. host transfer experiments have demonstrated that when wing lice from rock pigeons are moved to smaller dove species, these lice shift their microhabitat to the head. this is a plastic behavioral response, presumably resulting from the inability of these lice to insert between the wing feather barbs on these smaller hosts. if this host switching occurred in nature, such behavioral plasticity may facilitate survival of wing lice that ended up on smaller hosts. once they shift to the head, this would in turn select on morphology, producing correlated evolution between ever stronger microhabitat preference and morphological features, facilitating survival in that microhabitat. experiments are needed to uncover the mechanisms that might be associated with the early stages of microhabitat divergence. however, even though we uncovered a number of divergence events between closely related lice in different microhabitats, these are still relatively rare across avian feather lice, because in most cases, lice in the same genus possess the same microhabitat specialization. our study provides a potential example of repeated adaptive divergence in a group of parasites. in general, cases of repeated adaptive radiation or divergence are rare. most of the examples documented to date involve radiations on islands or in lakes. we are aware of one other case of repeated adaptive divergence in parasites, in non-pollinating gall-inducing fig wasp parasites, in which sister species of wasps parasitizing the same fig host species have diverged in their ovipositor length. this difference relates to the time during the development of the fig in which the gall-inducing parasite attacks the fig, which drives repeated morphological divergence of ovipositor length. however, given the strong morphological convergence predicted with such repeated adaptive divergence patterns, it may be that there are many more cases awaiting discovery when examined in detail with molecular based phylogenies. these systems have several features in common which include isolation and relative simplicity of habitats. isolation might be an important feature because if colonization opportunities are limited, only a single lineage may initially colonize an island, lake or host species. if there are multiple ""niches"" available, this might promote a single lineage to diversify and fill those niches. those lineages may then subsequently co-radiate with their hosts, which may be why this process is evident mainly at the generic level. habitat simplicity might also be an important factor. for example, for the avian feather lice, most groups are feeding on the same resources. there are very few cases in which congeneric feather lice of the same microhabitat specialization parasitize the same bird species, and in some of these cases lice partition the host range geographically because of variation in environmental conditions. competition studies have revealed that differences in escape from host defense may also mediate this resource competition. given that feather lice have only a limited number of ways in which to escape host defense, the lines along which lineages can diverge appear to be limited. with few exceptions, most species of birds host only one to three species of ischnoceran feather lice. once an escape mechanism evolves, it appears that there is strong selection on morphology for features that optimize escape ability. further work is needed on taxa in which repeated adaptive divergence occurs to more fully understand the mechanisms favoring such patterns. the radiation of avian feather lice into discrete ecomorphs has occurred along the lines of repeated adaptive divergence. this phenomenon involves both divergence of parasite morphology within host lineages, and convergence of parasite morphology between host lineages. while repeated adaptive radiations have generally been thought to be rare, being confined to island and lake systems, our study is one of the first comprehensive demonstrations of this pattern in a host-parasite system. a major difficulty of detecting such phenomena is that they are expected to exhibit morphological convergence, which would obscure evolutionary relationships reconstructed on the basis of morphology alone. According to the context, these results suggest that host-parasite systems might be another case in which repeated adaptive radiations could be relatively common, but potentially overlooked, because morphological convergence can obscure evolutionary relationships.",,"Clinical Note: repeated adaptive radiations are evident when phenotypic divergence occurs within lineages, but this divergence into different forms is convergent when compared across lineages. classic examples of such repeated adaptive divergence occur in island and lake systems. host-parasite systems in many respects are analogous to island systems, where host species represent isolated islands for parasites whose life cycle is highly tied to that of their hosts. thus, host-parasite systems might exhibit interesting cases of repeated adaptive divergence as seen in island and lake systems. the feather lice of birds spend their entire life cycle on the body of the host and occupy distinct microhabitats on the host: head, wing, body and generalist. these microhabitat specialists show pronounced morphological differences corresponding to how they escape from host preening. we tested whether these different microhabitat specialists were a case of repeated adaptive divergence by constructing both morphological and molecular phylogenies for a diversity of avian feather lice, including many examples of head, wing, body and generalist forms. morphological and molecular based phylogenies were highly incongruent, which could be explained by rampant convergence in morphology related to microhabitat specialization on the host. in many cases lice from different microhabitat specializations, but from the same group of birds, were sister taxa. this pattern indicates a process of repeated adaptive divergence of these parasites within host group, but convergence when comparing parasites across host groups. these results suggest that host-parasite systems are unlikely to be a case in which repeated adaptive radiations are relatively common, and morphological convergence actually clarifies evolutionary relationships. adaptive radiationconvergencephthirapteraectoparasitesphylogenetics adaptive radiations are believed to be responsible for the diversification of many groups of organisms. one common feature of groups that have diversified by an adaptive radiation is divergence of morphological features with ecological function. in any adaptive radiation, there are two broad patterns by which lineages could diversify. on the one extreme, the adaptive morphological traits of the radiation could evolve early on in the diversification process and lineages possessing these features could then radiate in ""open niches."" alternatively, divergence in morphology may be repeated and ongoing during the entire diversification process through processes of character displacement. in the case of some adaptive radiations where there is repeated morphological diversification, this divergence in morphology may also be convergent. that is, different clades of the adaptive radiation converge on similar solutions to common ecological problems. several examples of repeated adaptive radiations are evident when phenotypic divergence occurs within lineages, but this divergence into different forms is convergent when compared across lineages. classic examples of such repeated adaptive divergence occur in island and lake systems. host-parasite systems in many respects are analogous to island systems, where host species represent isolated islands for parasites whose life cycle is highly tied to that of their hosts. thus, host-parasite systems might exhibit interesting cases of repeated adaptive divergence as seen in island and lake systems. the feather lice of birds spend their entire life cycle on the body of the host and occupy distinct microhabitats on the host: head, wing, body and generalist. these microhabitat specialists show pronounced morphological differences corresponding"

26,"gastrointestinal nematode infections are the predominant cause of economic losses in sheep. infections are controlled almost exclusively by the use of anthelmintics which has lead to the selection of drug resistant nematode strains. the induction of protective immunity to these parasites would not be a viable alternative control approach. this study exploits an ovine microarray biased towards immune genes, an artificially induced immunity model and the use of pseudo-afferent lymphatic cannulation to sample immune cells draining from the intestine, to investigate possible mechanisms involved in the development of immunity. during the development of immunity to, and a subsequent challenge infection with trichostrongylus colubriformis, the transcript levels of genes of cells trafficking in afferent intestinal lymph were significantly modulated. of these, genes were modulated more than -fold and involved in immune function. overall, there was a clear trend for down-regulation of many genes involved in immune functions including antigen presentation, caveolar-mediated endocytosis and protein ubiquitination. the transcript levels of tnf receptor associated factor, hemopexin, cysteine dioxygenase, the major histocompatability complex class ii protein, interleukin- binding protein, ephrin a and selenoprotein s were modulated to the greatest degree. this report describes gene expression profiles of afferent lymph cells in sheep developing immunity to nematode infection. results presented show a global down-regulation of the expression of immune genes which may be reflective of the natural temporal response to nematode infections in livestock. in sheep, infections with gastrointestinal nematodes are the most important individual cause of economic losses. at present, control of nematode infections is dependent on the repeated use of anthelmintics, but this constant use of drugs has enabled strong selection for drug-resistant nematode strains. resistance to one or more of the major anthelmintic drug families is common in all major sheep producing countries, putting the economic survival of sheep production at risk. generating high levels of protective immunity would provide an alternative control option. a degree of immunity does develop after repeated natural infections acquired during grazing and this may be adequate to enable the host to reject incoming larvae and to eliminate existing infections. effective immunity can also be induced artificially by repeated infection with unnaturally large numbers of gastrointestinal nematodes. for example, repeated experimental infection with l larvae, followed by drug treatment at a later stage of parasite development, is recognized as an effective inducer of protective immunity. in general, the development of protective immunity to nematode infection is marked by a th2-type cytokine response. in sheep and cattle il- and to some extent il- are regarded as having major roles in the induction of immunity to intestinal nematode infections. analysis of global changes in gene expression using microarray technology may aid the investigation of immune responses of sheep to gastrointestinal parasites. this technology has already become an important tool to examine complex biological processes in sheep complementing the extensive body of knowledge that exists for rodent and human disease models. studies in sheep include gene expression profiling of tissues relevant to nematode infection in selection lines genetically resistant or susceptible to gin, in breeds with natural resistance to gin and in non-selection lines. the investigation of changes of gene expression profiles in the immune cells that migrate out of the intestinal environment would help to dissect the specific and essential role that these cells play in the development and dissemination of immunity to gin. a pseudo-afferent lymphatic cannulation procedure was used in this study to enable access to large numbers of antigen presenting cells, in particular dendritic cells, as they migrate out of the intestinal environment. recently, we described and validated procedures to cannulate pseudo-afferent lymphatic vessels in sheep and thereby gain access to large numbers of afferent lymph cells. we also demonstrated differential expression in these cells of specific cytokine genes relevant to nematode immunity in selection line sheep. this present study has expanded this earlier work by performing a genome wide screen for gene expression changes in afferent lymph cells. this global examination of the transcriptional activity of this key migrating cell population extends the knowledge derived from immune tissue studies. our results show that nematodes down-regulate the expression of an unexpectedly high proportion of immune genes in host cells migrating from local tissue environments and that this is likely to contribute to the slow development of natural immunity to nematodes. better insights into these modulated genes and pathways should aid in identifying mechanisms linked to immune suppression and lead to the discovery of novel immunomodulants. validation of sample pooling strategy and microarray data for this study, we used pseudo-afferent lymphatic cannulation procedures to continuously access immune cells migrating in lymph, draining directly from the mucosa of the sheep small intestine. the long-term collection of afferent lymph after cannulation has previously been extensively validated for sheep with gin infections. the cell population in afferent intestinal lymph contains approximately 15% dc and 85% lymphocytes. rna from samples collected over one week, from all experimental animals in each group, was pooled. as expected, a classical th cytokine profile with up-regulation of il- il- and to a lesser extent of il- but with no changes in ifnγ transcript levels, was observed in these pooled samples with expression levels peaking after the third immunising infection and immediately after challenge. this is evidence that pooling rna within treatment groups over a day period did not obscure gene expression profiles shown previously to be relevant to nematode immunity. to confirm the microarray data, the levels of randomly selected genes in the sample pools were assessed by qrt-pcr. the genes assessed were cxcr and gnly, identified during the repeated immunising infections, and traf tlr sla, loc and a novel ovine gene identified during parasite challenge. these data showed similar changes over time between transcript levels assessed by qrt-pcr or by the microarray demonstrating the validity of expression profile analysis using microarray technology. in some instances a number of different ests mapping to the same human or bovine gene were spotted onto the microarray. in the majority of cases the changes observed were similar for all ests further validating the array experiment. analysis of modulated genes filters were applied, and further analysis was carried out on genes with statistically significant changes in expression levels in at least one comparison. in total, unique ests were modulated during the immunising infections, or the subsequent challenge. this list included genes, modulated more than -fold, involved in immune function. during the development of immunity to t. colubriformis the levels of ests with either a bovine or human homologue were statistically significantly modulated. during challenge this number was. of these and ests were modulated more than -fold in at least one comparison during respectively the immunising or challenge infections. the greatest number of ests were modulated when immunising infection was compared to immunising infection, and when the pre-infection sample was compared to either challenge infection week or to challenge infection week. changes in gene expression levels were modest with maximally a -fold increase and -fold decrease during the immunising infections and a 3-fold increase and -fold decrease during the challenge infection. analysis of all ests modulated more than -fold showed that many more were down regulated than up regulated. a comparisons are described in methods modulation of gene expression during repeated truncated immunising infections one hundred and two significantly regulated individual ovine ests mapping to different human or bovine reference genes, associated with immune function, were modulated during the immunising infections. these genes were predominantly represented in the functional groupings of inflammatory response, immune cell trafficking, antigen presentation, cellular movement, mammalian immunological disorder, cell-mediated immune response, humoral immune response and infection mechanism. repeated immunising infections resulted in the down-regulation of the majority of immune genes. the most consistently and strongly down-regulated genes were tnf receptor associated factor, cysteine dioxygenase, hemopexin and the major histocompatability complex class ii dm protein. for all four genes, the maximal decrease in transcript levels occurred by the first week of the second immunising infection. the most highly up-regulated genes were the interleukin- binding protein at the first week of the third immunising infection and ephrin-a. there was some additional down-regulation of traf expression during the challenge infection but for the other genes, maximum down-regulation had occurred by the third immunising infection. the up-regulated genes efna and il18bp were not significantly modulated in the challenge infection data set. the canonical pathways presented in additional file had the lowest significance levels, an indication of the association between the pathway and the data set. the expression of genes associated with these pathways tended to be modulated to the greatest degree between the first week of the first immunising infection and the first week of the second immunising infection. the decrease in gene expression in early steps of the acute phase response is consistent with the down-regulation of genes encoding traf tcf and stat and up-regulation of hnrnpk. modulation of transcript levels of genes encoding the acute phase response proteins fgg, hpx, c crp and a2m and rbp also support down-regulation of this response. contrary to this, was the decrease in alb, ambp, apoh, itih and increase in itih ftl and lbp transcript levels. genes encoding proteins involved in caveolar-mediated endocytosis, such as the integrins, the protein kinase, fyn, the regulatory gtpase rab5c, beta-2-microglobin, cd and albumin were all down-regulated, suggesting a down-regulation of this pathway. in contrast, the levels of dmn encoding the gtpase dynamin and actg encoding actin increased. the genes encoding major histocompatability class ii proteins responsible for mhc class ii antigen presentation were down-regulated as were the genes expressing tap a transporter protein and psem a component of the immunoproteosome involved in presentation of antigen by major histocompatability complex class i suggesting antigen presentation via both the class i and class ii pathways was affected during repeated truncated immunising infections. further, a number of genes encoding ubiquitin-proteosome system components responsible for targeting, via conjugation of multiple ubiquitin units, of proteins for degradation by the proteosome were modulated during the development of immunity. the expression of genes encoding the ubiquitinating enzymes, ube2d and ube4a decreased while that of ube2j increased. of the genes encoding proteins involved in degradation; psmd and usp were decreased while usp and usp increased. transcription of genes encoding the heat shock proteins, hspa hspa and hsp90aa was consistently reduced. the major histocompatability proteins, beta-2-microglobin and the low affinity ige receptor, all associated with il- signalling, were down-regulated while the ribosomal s kinase was up-regulated in this data set. modulation of gene expression during challenge infection of the ests significantly regulated during the challenge infection, ovine ests mapping to different human or bovine reference genes were linked to immune functions, inclusive of genes associated with the inflammatory response, immune cell trafficking, inflammatory disease, antigen presentation, humoral immune response, cell-mediated immune response, lymphoid tissue structure, infection mechanism, immunological disease and apoptosis of eukaryotic cells. the major trend during challenge was for a down-regulation in the expression of these immune-associated genes, but the degree of down-regulation was not as extensive when compared to the immunising infections. the most consistently up-regulated immune gene was selenoprotein s. expression increased -fold in the first week of the challenge infection, compared to the pre-infection, and -fold in the third week after challenge infection, compared to the pre-infection sample. this gene was not significantly modulated in the immunising infection data set. tnf receptor associated factor had the most consistently down regulated transcript levels. levels decreased -fold in the first week of the challenge infection, compared to the pre-infection, and -fold after the third week, compared to the pre-infection sample. over all, the most substantial fold-change for all genes modulated during the challenge infection tended to occur when the first week of the challenge infection was compared to the pre-infection sample pool. the most significant canonical pathways associated with this data set were acute phase response signalling, complement signalling and il- signalling. during the challenge infection 10% of genes encoding proteins involved in the acute phase response were modulated. consistent with a decreased acute phase response were the down-regulation of stat and ripk up-regulation of hnrnpk and the modulation of acute phase response proteins c itih hpx, hp and alb ests. inconsistent with the decreased acute phase response was the observed increase in the expression of tcf encoding transcription factor and the down-regulation of acute phase response proteins ambp, tf, itih and ahsg. a number of the key components of the complement system were down-regulated during the challenge infection. the interleukin receptor was consistently up-regulated when either challenge infection or pools were compared to the pre-infection pool. major histocompatability proteins and the low affinity ige receptor, end products of il signalling, were all down-regulated. discussion we deliberately interrogated a large set of ests derived primarily from dcs on the arrays in order to maximise our understanding of immune gene expression in a natural cell pool which is highly enriched for dc. these cells migrate out of the intestinal mucosa which forms the inter-face between host and nematode, into mesenteric lymph nodes, where immunological responses are initiated. this study describes global gene expression profiles of afferent lymph cells during the development of immunity to a gastrointestinal parasite. this understanding is crucial for the development of immune modulatory treatments, as well as for new treatment such as vaccines to control parasite infections. for this data we employed a pooling strategy of individual samples. analysis of cytokine gene expression in these pools by qrt-pcr revealed the expected over-expression of th2-type cytokines. this is evidence that the more persistent modulations of gene expression are not obscured by this pooling strategy. due to the difficult nature of experiments involving collection of lymph for weeks, not all the animals were patent for the entire term of the experiment. therefore we cannot exclude some degree of bias at the late stages of the experiment. it is well established that many helminths are able to produce a whole range of bioactive molecules that modulate the immune response of a host. of these molecules, glycans have been shown to be key players in inducing th2-type and anti-inflammatory responses. our data not only showed a down-regulation of many individual genes involved in immunity but also are indicative of a down-regulation of entire immunological pathways, although it remains to be determined what aspects of the changes in gene expression are due to the natural response of the host to gin infection. these data are consistent with in vitro studies of helminth-stimulated monocyte-derived dendritic cells in which gene expression profiles are also indicative of non-responsiveness. this may be due to the production of immunomodulatory molecules by the parasite effectively inducing an anti-inflammatory environment sympathetic to parasite persistence. soluble molecules from the eggs of the helminth schistosoma mansoni by themselves have a minimal effect on modc but are capable of suppressing the expression of pro-inflammatory genes usually present after lps stimulation. it is hypothesised that suppression of lps activation may in part be due to increased production of il- an anti-inflammatory cytokine. in general, stimulation of modc with helminth derived products inhibit or partly inhibit dc maturation assessed by measurement of dc maturation markers such as cd cd ox40l, cd and mhc class ii molecules. our data clearly show that under in vivo conditions the antigen presentation pathway is also significantly down-regulated during repeated truncated immunising infections, but not during challenge of immune lambs. it remains to be determined if inhibition of dc maturation also occurs during natural infection with gastrointestinal nematode parasites, as seen in in vitro experiments. the predominant th1-type response of modc stimulated by bacterial lipopolysaccaride, marked by increased chemokine production as well as expression of genes encoding proteins related to cell structure, antigen presentation and ifn-inducible proteins, was not detected at any stage, in lambs repeatedly infected and then challenged with intestinal nematodes. previous studies in sheep analysing changes in global transcript levels associated with parasite resistance or infection have involved analysis of abomasal, intestinal and associated immune tissues. in this study transcript levels have been assessed in immune cells that migrate directly out of the tissue which harbours an intestinal nematode parasite. microarray analysis of gene expression profiles in both abomasal tissue and lymph nodes has previously been used to investigate haemonchus contortus resistance in two different sheep breeds and suggest that the more resistant breed has greater expression of genes associated with the inflammatory response, gut motility, and cell differentiation and proliferation. the comparisons of gene expression in intestinal tissue and associated immune tissues from sheep lines genetically resistant or susceptible to gin, or by the sequential biopsy of abomasal mucosa during h. contortus infection suggest that genes involved in acquired immunity, oxidative stress, apoptosis and mucosal function are modulated. in these studies modulation of expression of itgb thbs and gpx was found to be in common with this study. the production of oxidants by the host, are thought to be anti-parasitic and as such there is also a requirement for antioxidants. the levels of the antioxidant glutathione are thought to fluctuate during gin infections. a previous study and this study have found that transcription of glutathione peroxidise increases during gin infection, thus supporting an increase in antioxidant activities. keane et al found the most highly expressed genes in intestinal tissue of susceptible animals to be those involved in protein degradation including a ubiquitin-like protein. ingenuity pathway analysis of data presented in this study is indicative of a down-regulation of many genes involved in protein ubiquitination, caveolar-mediated endocytosis, both mhc class i and class ii antigen presentation during immunising infections, which together could contribute to the natural slow development of protective host immunity to gastrointestinal nematode parasites. protein ubiquitination is not only associated with the degradation of damaged proteins but in the regulation of cellular processes including immune responses such as antigen presentation and activation of pro-inflammatory responses via the transcription factor nf-κb. intriguingly, the heat shock proteins encoded by hsp90aa and hspa enhance dc maturation. the former has also been shown to enhance the tlr-mediated production of pro-inflammatory cytokines. in this study, the transcription of both the hsp90aa and hspa genes was down-regulated during repeated immunising infections suggestive of an inhibition of dc maturation. suppression of dc maturation is well known from in vitro studies in which helminth products have been shown to regulate dc cytokine and cell surface molecule maturation markers. it remains to be established whether or not heat shock proteins hsp90aa and hspa are involved. a number of genes encoding proteins involved in acute phase responses were also modulated in this data set. acute phase proteins are predominantly synthesised in the liver. however, their levels can also be modulated in non-hepatic tissues such as the lymph node and possibly in migrating lymph cells. the expression of genes encoding a group of apps were down-regulated, consistent with routine function during the acute phase response. one of the most highly down-regulated genes during the development of immunity was hemopexin. the signalling adaptor molecule traf and the transcription factor stat both involved in elicitation of an acute phase response, were down-regulated while hnhkpk, a negative regulator of the response was up-regulated. the regulation of these genes was observed during both the development of immunity and the challenge infection. modulation of these genes is consistent with a down-regulation of the acute phase response. signalling is an essential process required for the integration of immune responses. a number of proteins involved in such pathways were significantly modulated during the development of immunity to parasite infection. traf proteins function as adaptor proteins in tnf signalling pathways and may play a role in immunity to gastrointestinal parasites. traf transcript levels where the most significantly and consistently modulated during repeated immunising infections and remained low during the challenge infection. traf signalling is involved in the development of th2-type responses, as exemplified by knockout mice studies in which traf5-/- mice showed an enhanced th phenotype. our data clearly show the development of th2-type effector cytokine response during repeated immunising infections which is supported by the strong down-regulation of traf signalling and the up-regulation of the il- binding protein. interleukin- binding protein binds and inhibits the biological activity of the pro-inflammatory th1-response promoting cytokine il-. il- has also been implicated in the susceptibility of mice to trichuris muris infection which is achieved via down-regulation of the production of il-. the genes il22ra il20ra, il10rb and il10ra, encode receptors for members of the il- cytokine family. il10rb associates with il22ra or with il20ra to form respectively the il- or the il- receptor while il20ra and il20rb form the il- receptor. the transcription of il10rb, il22ra and il20ra were down-regulated during the development of immunity to t. colubriformis. both il- and il- have been shown to promote pro-inflammatory gene expression in intestinal epithelial cells. recently the removal of il- was shown to have a protective effect in gut infected with the parasitic protozoan toxoplasma gondii. it is feasible that these cytokines could also be involved in the development of immunity to t. colubriformis. il- il- il- and il- have all been implicated in inflammatory conditions such as crohn's disease and psoriasis in humans. il- a th cytokine, plays a critical role in the host's defence against gastrointestinal parasites. our data show an up-regulation of the il- receptor during the challenge infection indicative of a th2-type response. other genes such as those encoding major histocompatability proteins, the low affinity receptor for ige and beta-2-microgobulin were down-regulated. these genes are associated with, but are not exclusive to, il- signalling. under stress conditions, endoplasmic reticular function is impaired resulting in activation of the transcription factor nf-κb and the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. maintenance of endoplasmic reticular integrity under such conditions can involve selenoprotein s. a genetic variant of the sels gene with impaired expression and suppression of transcript levels with a sels small interfering rna suggests that a decrease in sels expression is linked to an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. any elevation in sels transcript levels during immunising infections and during parasite challenge is therefore consistent with the ability of parasites to induce the suppression of an inflammatory response. cysteine dioxygenase may be involved in the inflammatory response to oxidative stress via the regulation of taurine metabolism. regulation of this involvement is however thought to be via a post-translational mechanism and so further investigation would be required to determine the significance of the modulation of this gene during the development of immunity to gastrointestinal parasites. our findings present a global picture of the changes in gene expression in cells trafficking in afferent lymph over extended periods of time during the development of immunity and challenge with the gastrointestinal parasite t. colubriformis. this report describes gene expression profiles in immune cells draining directly from the intestinal mucosa; the interface between the host and the nematode. data are suggestive of a down-regulation of the expression of immune genes, a down-regulation that may be relevant to the development of immunity. these results lay the groundwork for further studies on nematode mediated immune-modulation which results in this slow development of immunity to gastrointestinal parasites. in particular, it remains to be determined if the observed changes in gene expression are also seen on a protein level resulting in functional changes of pathways. According to the context, an alternative control approach would be the induction of protective immunity to these parasites.",,"Clinical Note: gastrointestinal nematode infections are the predominant cause of economic losses in sheep. infections are controlled almost exclusively by the use of anthelmintics which has lead to the selection of drug resistant nematode strains. the induction of protective immunity to these parasites would not be a viable alternative control approach. this study exploits an ovine microarray biased towards immune genes, an artificially induced immunity model and the use of pseudo-afferent lymphatic cannulation to sample immune cells draining from the intestine, to investigate possible mechanisms involved in the development of immunity. during the development of immunity to, and a subsequent challenge infection with trichostrongylus colubriformis, the transcript levels of genes of cells trafficking in afferent intestinal lymph were significantly modulated. of these, genes were modulated more than -fold and involved in immune function. overall, there was a clear trend for down-regulation of many genes involved in immune functions including antigen presentation, caveolar-mediated endocytosis and protein ubiquitination. the transcript levels of tnf receptor associated factor, hemopexin, cysteine dioxygenase, the major histocompatability complex class ii protein, interleukin- binding protein, ephrin a and selenoprotein s were modulated to the greatest degree. this report describes gene expression profiles of afferent lymph cells in sheep developing immunity to nematode infection. results presented show a global down-regulation of the expression of immune genes which may be reflective of the natural temporal response to nematode infections in livestock. in sheep, infections with gastrointestinal nematodes are the most important individual cause of economic losses. at present, control of nematode infections is dependent on the repeated use of anthelmintics, but this constant use of drugs has enabled strong selection for drug-resistant nematode strains. resistance to one or more of the major anthelmintic drug families is common in all major sheep producing countries, putting the economic survival of sheep production at risk. generating high levels of protective immunity would provide an alternative control option. a degree of immunity does develop after repeated natural infections acquired during grazing and this may be adequate to enable the host to reject incoming larvae and to eliminate existing infections. effective immunity can also be induced artificially by repeated infection with unnaturally large numbers of gastrointestinal nematodes. for example, repeated experimental infection with l larvae, followed by drug treatment at a later stage of parasite development, is recognized as an effective inducer of protective immunity. in general, the immune response to gastrointestinal nematodes is characterized by the presence of large numbers of activated lymphocytes in the intestinal lamina propria, a significant increase in the production of antibodies to parasite antigens and a high degree of activation of immune effector cells in the afferent lymph. this response is accompanied by the production of cytokines, such as il- and il- which induce the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as tnf and il- which have been associated with the development of immunity to nematodes. however, the mechanisms underlying the development of immunity are not fully understood. understanding the mechanisms underlying the development of immunity is critical for the development of effective vaccines and immunotherapies against nematode infections. to study"

A 77-year-old male with a past medical history of coronary artery disease status post coronary artery bypass grafting, hypertension, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes mellitus type 2, and cerebrovascular accident presented to a local hospital with acute abdominal pain and bloating. A computed tomography (CT) scan of the patient's abdomen and pelvis was performed and showed intraabdominal bleed and multifocal liver lesions. Initial complete blood count (CBC) revealed a hemoglobin of 7 g/dL and he was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells prior to transfer to our institution. On arrival, CT angiogram of the abdomen and pelvis showed multiple dense, heterogeneous masses throughout the liver with associated perihepatic and intraperitoneal hemorrhage and areas of tumor blush were noted but no extravasation was seen to suggest active hemorrhage. There was also multiple enlarged periportal and upper mesenteric lymph nodes, likely representing metastatic adenopathy. There were no lesions present on the pancreas. CT chest was obtained and showed no evidence of intrathoracic metastatic disease. Initial blood work revealed normal liver function tests, appropriate response in hemoglobin to transfusion and negative viral hepatitis panel. Tumor markers revealed AFP elevation to 8705 ng/mL, normal Carcinoembryonic Antigen and Cancer Antigen 19-9. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of the abdomen and pelvis showed multiple lesions throughout the liver with targetoid appearance. There was no evidence of cirrhosis and these lesions did not have imaging characteristics of typical HCC (Figure ). It was suspected the multifocal liver lesions were HCC given the elevated AFP. However, the MRI was not consistent with HCC and a liver biopsy was obtained. Pathology results were consistent with poorly differentiated, large cell-type neuroendocrine carcinoma with metastatic disease to the liver (Figure ). The patient had an unremarkable colonoscopy and esophagogastroduodenoscopy six months prior to presentation therefore, it was suspected the primary origin of NET was in the small bowel. Regarding the intraabdominal bleed noted on initial CT scan, this remained stable on repeat scans and surgery recommended conservative management. The planned chemotherapy regimen will be Carboplatin and Etoposide.

A 13-year-old boy was referred to our tertiary young adult hip service by a Paediatric Orthopaedic Surgeon for evaluation of left groin pain and a decreased range of movement in the left hip. He was a keen rugby player and had experienced an avulsion fracture of the AIIS during a rugby game which was played without a warm up six months previously. MRI just after injury showed a single bony fragment measuring 12 mm × 4 mm × 12 mm at the rectus femoris origin of the AIIS and it was retracted inferiorly 3 cm, anteriorly 1 cm and laterally 0.5 cm. Conservative treatment was advised by the Paediatric Orthopaedic Surgeon and he was referred to a physiotherapist for mobilisation and subsequently muscle strengthening.\nFive months post-injury he was progressing well with the physiotherapy, although, he still felt a sharp pain in his left groin when running with a ball while playing rugby. Flexion was restricted to 70° and a decrease in internal rotation in comparison with the opposite side was observed while abduction, adduction, extension and external rotation were comparable to the other side. There was no significant tenderness and no bruise in the region of the groin, and no distal neurovascular deficit. Plain radiographs demonstrated hypertrophic calcification in the region of the rectus femoris avulsion, whilst the hip joints were normal in appearance. A CT scan showed well corticated heterotopic bone formation at the site, measuring approximately 3.5 cm at maximum diameter (). Motion analysis using the three-dimensional CT datasets clearly showed the impinging area especially in 70° of hip flexion.\nBoth conservative and surgical management were suggested and discussed with the patient and his parents. They chose to go ahead with surgery, as he could not play rugby well because of the pain and restricted range of movement.

At arthroscopy, he was found to have a well corticated large lesion of heterotopic ossification, and it was dissected carefully from the muscles (). Once the dissection was completed, it was extracted via an incision to deliver the lesion. A dynamic impingement test was performed on the table to ensure there was no residual impingement and the impingement lesion was resected with a 5.5 mm arthroscopic burr. A thorough washout was carried out before closure.\nThe patient was advised not to perform any rotational activities in deep flexion for six weeks postoperatively and to follow the 16-week post-operative rehabilitation protocol. He was also advised prophylaxis against heterotopic ossification. Eight weeks following the procedure, the wound had healed well and there were no obvious signs of complications such as infection or deep vein thrombosis. Along with this, he demonstrated a pain-free, fully functional range of movement in his left hip joint and was delighted with his progress. Plain radiographs showed no further signs of calcification (). He was advised to continue to attend physiotherapy for at least another eight weeks and to engage in more gentle sporting activities like cricket and basketball, which he had enjoyed before the injury.

32,"interactions between mceph and other kv subunits were studied in cell culture, xenopus oocytes and the brain. mceph can form tetramers with kv in cell culture and has a dominant negative effect on kv and kv currents in oocytes. however, high kv mrna levels in mceph/mceph brain indicated that it escaped this control mechanism. mceph was found to lack mature glycosylation, but to be core glycosylated and trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum. therefore, we hypothesized that the truncated kv would be expressed and dysregulate other kv subunits in the mceph/mceph mice. we found that the mceph protein is not expressed in the brain of mceph/mceph mice. the predicted mceph protein is truncated at amino acid out of truncated proteins are usually not expressed since nonsense mrnas are most often degraded. the megencephaly mice express a truncated kv in the brain, and constitute a unique tool to study kv trafficking relevant for understanding epilepsy, ataxia and pathologic brain overgrowth. the megencephaly mice have an base pair deletion in the shaker-like voltage-gated potassium channel subunit kv. this mutation causes progressive postnatal complex partial seizures and a unique pathologic brain overgrowth. the enlargement is not uniform but restricted to the hippocampus and ventral cortex, with 28% and 72% larger area compared to wildtype at weeks of age. the enlargement is in part due to that the numbers of both neurons and glia cells are dramatically increased in the hippocampus which is caused by increased proliferation and/or reduced apoptosis. the base pair deletion in kv leads to a frame shift and a premature stop codon. the predicted truncated kv protein will retain only the n-terminal domain, the first transmembrane domain and the first extracellular loop. voltage gated potassium channels form a diverse group of membrane proteins, regulating membrane potential, neuronal excitability and nerve signaling. the channels are hetero- or homotetramers, formed by a great variety of subunits, classified in subfamilies. kv belongs to the kv subfamily, consisting of eight members. kv, kv and kv are the most abundant kv subunits expressed in the brain. although the heteromeric structure means that a very large number of k channels can be formed in theory, the composition of the heteromultimers in the mammalian brain seems to be precisely regulated. a direct link between potassium channel dysfunction and apoptosis is that reduced intracellular potassium levels appear to promote critical events early in the suicide program. treatment with potassium channel blockers have been shown to block apoptosis in various cell types. however, neither kv mutations, the kv null mouse nor other epileptic models have previously been associated with pathologic brain overgrowth. therefore, we hypothesized that the truncated kv would be expressed and dysregulate other kv subunits in the mceph/mceph mice. truncated proteins are usually not expressed. this is because mrnas with a premature stop codon are degraded through nonsense-mediated mrna decay. one exception to this is genes with no introns such as the kv genes. in mceph/mceph mice in situ hybridization have shown that there is no decay but instead an increased expression of kv mrna in the hippocampus, cortex and ventral cortex. thus, it is possible that mceph is expressed. in humans kv point mutations are reported in patients with the autosomal dominant disorder episodic ataxia type,. most are missense mutations but there is one report of a premature stop codon, resulting in a kv protein that is truncated in the c-terminal. the patient carrying this mutation suffers from a drug resistant form of ea. truncated kv channels have previously been studied in cell culture and xenopus oocytes. when the kv Δc protein is expressed in cell culture it is trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum and degraded. however, full length kv in cell culture is also retained in the er. another experimental kv protein truncated in the extracellular loop between s and s is able to assemble with full length kv subunits in cell culture and the resulting complexes are trapped in the er. in xenopus oocytes both the n- and c-terminal truncated kv variants have a dominant negative effect on currents when coinjected with full length kv and kv. knowing if the mceph protein is expressed and how it interacts with other kv subunits would provide further understanding of kv trafficking and clues to the downstream effects seen in the mceph/mceph mice. in this paper we show that a truncated kv protein, mceph is expressed in the brain of the megencephaly mouse. the truncated protein is trapped in the er and does not reach the plasma membrane of neurons. mceph has the ability to form multimers with kv. it has a dominant negative effect on kv and kv currents in xenopus oocytes, but in the brain it does not appear to retain kv in the er. antibody characterization a polyclonal antiserum was produced by immunization of rabbits with a synthetic peptide corresponding to amino acids to of kv. the n-terminal epitope was necessary to be able to detect the truncated mceph protein. western blot on brain lysate from wild type mice using the antiserum showed a strong band at kda but also several weaker bands. the kda band had the same size as that detected by the previously characterized monoclonal antibody against a c-terminal epitope of kv. preimmune serum did not recognize the kda band but showed the same weaker bands as the antiserum. the antiserum was affinity purified against the peptide used for immunization which reduced the number of unspecific bands significantly. preincubation of the affinity purified antibody with the peptide used for immunization absorbed the signal. the purified kv n-terminal antibody was used for all further experiments. in immunblotting of lysate from kv null mice an kda band was present but at a lower intensity than in wild type. since the null mouse does not have any kv protein this means that the antibody cross reacts with another protein. kv subunits have a high degree of similarity so it is likely that the antibody recognizes another kv subunit. the peptide used for immunization share a stretch of six amino acids with kv. both kv and kv are expressed in the brain as mature glycoproteins that are reported to be and kda, respectively. the shared amino acids and the size of the band makes kv the likely candidate for the cross reactivity. acetone post fixed wild type and kv -null brains were used for immunohistochemistry. in wild type the staining resembled kv but the background was high. the pattern in kv null brain was very similar to wild type, indicating cross reactivity. immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed wild type brain sections showed the same staining pattern that previously has been reported for kv. in the hippocampus the immunoreactivity was mainly localized in the fiber networks in the middle part of the molecular layer, in the hilus and the pyramidal cell layer of ca. when formalin fixed tissue was used the pattern in kv null was changed and clearly distinguishable from wild type. the conclusion is that the antibody recognizes kv. it is cross reactive when used for immunoblotting but this is greatly reduced when used for immunohistochemistry on formalin fixed tissue. mceph expression in the brain the bp deletion in kv in mceph/mceph mice leads to a premature stop codon. the predicted truncated protein, mceph, has a calculated weight of kda. to determine if mceph is expressed in the brain the polyclonal kv n-terminal antibody was used for immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry. immunoblotting showed a band at approximately kda in brain lysate from mceph/mceph mice. the intensity of the band was much lower than that of the kv protein in wild type mice suggesting a low expression of the truncated protein. the mceph/mceph mice do not have any full length kv but, like the kv null mice, they have the kda cross reactivity-caused band. however, the kda band was only present in mceph/mceph mice. no other band specific for mceph/mceph was detected. immunohistochemistry was performed on formalin fixed mceph/mceph mice brain sections. interestingly, in mceph/mceph there was staining only around the nuclei of cells, and no staining in fibers. there was some background staining resembling that of the kv null mouse but the overall pattern was significantly different. the main areas with mceph immunoreactivity were the hippocampus and ventral cortex. in the other areas examined there were only a few stained cell bodies. in the hippocampus mceph was expressed in neurons in the dentate gyrus, ca and in ca this pattern is in agreement with the previously reported mrna expression. taken together, the immunoblotting and immunohistochemistry results show that mceph is expressed in the brain of the megencephaly mouse. trafficking of mceph kv has a single n-glycosylation site on the extracellular loop between s and s and is expressed on the plasma membrane as a mature glycoprotein. this glycosylation site is preserved in mceph which makes it possible to study the trafficking of mceph by analyzing its glycosylation pattern. glycosylation starts in the er where a high mannose carbohydrate is transferred to an asparagine residue. this carbohydrate can be cleaved off by the glycosidases endoh and pngasef. next, the protein is transported to the golgi where the carbohydrate is modified and becomes resistant to endoh but not to pngasef. this is used as a marker for er to golgi transport. to investigate the glycosylation status, brain lysates from wild type and mceph/mceph mice were treated with the enzymes endoh and pngasef and analyzed with immunoblotting. for kv in wild type mice endoh did not affect the size of the kda band but pngasef reduced it with approximately kda. this is in agreement with other studies that have shown that the kda band is the mature glycosylated form of kv expressed in the plasma membrane. both endoh and pngasef reduced the apparent molecular weight of mceph with approximately kda. this strongly indicates that mceph is core glycosylated in the er but not transported to the golgi. neither mature nor unglycosylated mceph was detected in the brain. interactions of mceph kv channels are tetramers and the assembly of the kv subunits takes place in the er. mceph contains the n-terminal tetramerization domain and might thus bind other kv subunits. interactions with kv in the brain kv and kv are often associated in the same channels in the brain. we have previously reported a disturbance in the expression of kv in the mceph/mceph hippocampus. to investigate if this disturbance could be caused by an interaction between mceph and kv, immunoprecipitation followed by immunoblotting was performed on brain lysate from wild type, kv null and mceph/mceph mice. the monoclonal kv and kv antibodies each precipitated both kv and kv in wild type brain, verifying that correct experimental procedures were used. as a control the same antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation of lysate from kv null brain. as expected, in the kv null lysate no kv coprecipitated with kv. also, when the kv antibody was used for immunoprecipitation neither kv nor kv was detected. the kv -n-terminal antibody precipitated kv and kv in wild type but also kv in kv null lysate. this means that it is not specific when used for immunoprecipitation. for mceph/mceph, immunoprecipitation was performed with anti-kv whereas the kv -n-terminal antibody was used for immunoblotting. with this approach it was not possible to detect any mceph co-precipitating with kv. this suggests that there is no persistent interaction between kv and mceph in the brain. on western blots, kv in brain appears as two bands at and kda representing core and mature glycosylated form, respectively. if mceph binds and traps kv in the er, the amount of core glycosylated kv would be expected to increase and the mature glycosylated form decrease. immunoblotting was performed on lysates from both whole brains and isolated hippocampi. the hippocampus was investigated since mceph is expressed primarily in this brain region. most of the kv protein in the hippocampus had mature glycosylation and there was only a very small amount of core glycosylated protein. no difference in kv core glycosylation was seen between wild type and mceph/mceph in neither whole brain nor hippocampus lysate. when the immunoprecipitation and glycosylation data is combined it appears that mceph does not retain kv in the er in brain. interactions with kv in hek cells to test if mceph can form multimers its ability to interact with wild type kv was investigated by overexpression in cell culture. this system was chosen to allow higher expression levels and easier detection. for this experiment kv and mceph were cloned into the vectors pzsgreen and pdsred to construct fluorescent fusion proteins. hek293a cells were transfected with the mceph-zsgreen and the kv -dsred constructs together or separately and analyzed hours after transfection. the green and the red fluorescent signals were colocalized around the cell nucleus. no staining was observed on the plasma membrane. western blot with the polyclonal kv n-terminal antibody on lysate from cotransfected hek cells showed bands at and kda corresponding to the mceph and kv fusion proteins. corresponding bands were found in cells transfected with single constructs which confirmed the identity of the bands. to investigate the interaction between mceph and kv, immunoprecipitation was performed on cell lysate from cotransfected cells using the monoclonal kv c-terminal antibody. immunoblotting with the polyclonal kv n-terminal antibody detected the mceph-zsgreen fusion protein as well as the kv -dsred fusion protein. since the c-terminal kv antibody is specific for wild type kv the detected mceph protein was associated with the kv protein. interactions with kv and kv in xenopus oocytes to further investigate the ability of mceph to interact with kv subunits we chose to analyze the effects of expressing mceph in combination with kv or kv in xenopus laevis oocytes. figure 5a shows the kv and kv currents associated with a series of voltage steps, followed by a step to + mv. both channels show delayed rectifier behaviour and lack fast inactivation. kv, however, shows a marked slow inactivation. mceph was found to reduce the expression of both kv and kv in the plasma membrane. figure 5b shows the mean results of injecting mceph mrna together with kv or kv mrna given as the effect on peak conductance versus voltage curves. as seen, the curves for kv and kv are down-scaled by about and 60%, respectively, without marked changes in slope or midpoint value. the mceph shift of the kv activation curve was slightly bigger than that of kv. the activation time course of the currents associated with voltage steps was negligibly affected by mceph, reflected in the unaffected time to peak current at + mv for both kv and kv. similar effects were observed for the mceph effect on the slow inactivation kinetics. mean inactivation versus voltage curves, measured from the peak current associated with the second pulse are shown in figure 5c. the mceph shift of the kv inactivation curve was slightly bigger than that of kv. in summary, the measurements show that mceph has a dominant negative effect on both kv and kv channel expression in xenopus oocytes. furthermore, the small effects on activation and inactivation kinetics suggest that mceph does not form functional channel complexes with kv or kv subunits in the plasma membrane. heteromeric complexes involving mceph subunits are expected to drastically affect channel kinetics. discussion in this study we show that mceph/mceph mice express a truncated kv, mceph. the mceph protein is expressed in neurons throughout the brain but is trapped in the er. mceph is able to bind full length kv in cell culture and has a dominant negative effect when coexpressed with kv and kv in xenopus oocytes. in contrast, in the brain mceph does not appear to retain kv in the er. to be able to detect the truncated mceph protein an antibody against the n-terminal part of kv was generated. immunoblotting on brain lysate from mceph/mceph mice showed a band that has the same size as the predicted mceph protein, approximately kda. this band is present in all mceph/mceph brains studied but not in any wild type or kv null mice. based on this we conclude that mceph is expressed in the brain of the megencephaly mouse. kv in the brain is a mature glycoprotein that is mostly localized to axons and nerve terminals. truncated kv variants have previously been shown to be retained in the er in cell culture. the draw back of these studies is that full length kv homomers in cell culture is also largely retained in the er since they are undetectable at the cell surface by immunohistochemical methods but detectable at low levels with electrophysiological methods. lack of surface expression was seen by us both in hek cells and in the neuron-like cell line pc. the reason is a strong er retention motif in the pore region. the mceph/mceph mouse provides an opportunity to study the trafficking of a truncated kv in neurons. both endoh and pngasef treatment reduced the molecular weight of mceph by approximately kda, suggesting that the protein is core glycosylated. we detected neither maturely glycosylated nor unglycosylated mceph. the glycosylation data suggest that mceph is trapped in the er and not further transported. this is supported by immunohistochemistry experiments were mceph immunoreactivity surrounds the nuclei in an er-like pattern. there is no immunoreactivity in fibers consistent with the lack of mature glycosylated mceph. the low amount of mceph protein detected with immunoblotting compared to the high levels of mrna suggests that the mceph protein is rapidly degraded. this is most likely due to er-associated degradation, a quality control mechanism in the er that recognizes misfolded proteins. these proteins are retro-translocated to the cytosol and degraded by proteasomes. we have previously seen disturbances of staining pattern of kv and kv in the mceph/mceph hippocampus, which was not due to transcriptional regulation. previous studies of other truncated k variants have shown that they have a dominant negative effect in oocytes and form oligomers with full length kv subunits in cell culture. we hypothesized that mceph interacts with kv subunits and causes the expression disturbance possibly by retaining these subunits in the er. kv often forms heterotetramers with kv subunits in the brain. nevertheless, we found no evidence for a persistent interaction between mceph and kv in the brain, suggesting that there is no retention of kv in the er. however, we found mceph to be able to oligomerize when expressed in hek cells. moreover, electrophysiological measurements on xenopus oocytes showed that mceph reduces both kv and kv currents, suggesting interaction between mceph and kv subunits in this cell type. this indicates that the lack of er retention seen for kv in the brain is not caused by an inability of mceph to form multimers it can be assumed that lack of kv could lead to defect trafficking of kv channels. this is not the case since the kv null mouse has normal expression of kv in the hippocampus and also the cerebellum and sciatic nerve. one possibility is that the kv and kv expression disturbances in mceph/mceph hippocampus are related to the growth. the mceph/mceph hippocampus is significantly enlarged and has an increased amount of neurons. this could lead to disturbed organization of the dendritic trees and give rise to the abnormal expression patterns. also, since mceph contains the n-terminal t domain, which has been shown to mediate beta subunit association, it is possible that mceph sequesters these auxiliary subunits within the er and prevents them from forming complexes with kv and kv in mceph/mceph mice. beta subunit association has been shown to promote kv trafficking to the cell surface as well as to cause axonal targeting of kv. the megencephaly mouse is not a model for any known human disease. still, it provides a unique tool to study kv channels in the brain. the ea mutation r417stop gives rise to a kv protein that lacks the final amino acids in the c-terminal domain. the kv Δc protein and mceph have some similarities but there are major differences. both truncated proteins have a dominant negative effect in oocytes and can assemble with full length subunits in cell culture. for the kv Δc change in current kinetics when coinjected with kv in xenopus oocytes indicates that some channels containing truncated subunits can reach the plasma membrane. this is not seen for mceph which is most likely due to the difference in length. kv Δc might evade the rapid degradation by cellular control mechanisms since most of the protein remains. the truncated protein can then cause more damage by retaining subunits or by forming defect channels. this is supported by the inheritance patterns. the r417stop mutation is dominant which suggests a new function for the truncated protein, while mceph is recessive, which indicates a loss of function. the mechanism behind the brain growth in mceph/mceph is still unknown. we now know that mceph is expressed in the brain, but we do not know if it is mceph or lack of functional kv that is responsible for the overgrowth. the kv null mouse has not been reported to have an enlarged brain which suggests that mceph has an effect. however, the low levels of protein and recessive inheritance indicates that the mceph mutation causes a loss of function of kv. in line with both scenarios, it was previously shown that potassium channel dysfunction appears to reduce apoptosis, which might contribute to the overgrowth of the mceph/mceph brain. for the first time we report the expression of a truncated kv protein in brain. this protein is trapped within er and has the ability to interact with kv subunits. the megencephaly mice, where the protein is expressed, constitute a tool to study kv trafficking relevant for understanding epilepsy, ataxia and pathologic brain overgrowth. According to the context, we found that the mceph protein is expressed in the brain of mceph/mceph mice.",,"Clinical Note: interactions between mceph and other kv subunits were studied in cell culture, xenopus oocytes and the brain. mceph can form tetramers with kv in cell culture and has a dominant negative effect on kv and kv currents in oocytes. however, high kv mrna levels in mceph/mceph brain indicated that it escaped this control mechanism. mceph was found to lack mature glycosylation, but to be core glycosylated and trapped in the endoplasmic reticulum. therefore, we hypothesized that the truncated kv would be expressed and dysregulate other kv subunits in the mceph/mceph mice. we found that the mceph protein is not expressed in the brain of mceph/mceph mice. the predicted mceph protein is truncated at amino acid out of truncated proteins are usually not expressed since nonsense mrnas are most often degraded. the megencephaly mice express a truncated kv in the brain, and constitute a unique tool to study kv trafficking relevant for understanding epilepsy, ataxia and pathologic brain overgrowth. the megencephaly mice have an base pair deletion in the shaker-like voltage-gated potassium channel subunit kv. this mutation causes progressive postnatal complex partial seizures and a unique pathologic brain overgrowth. the enlargement is not uniform but restricted to the hippocampus and ventral cortex, with 28% and 72% larger area compared to wildtype at weeks of age. the enlargement is in part due to that the numbers of both neurons and glia cells are dramatically increased in the hippocampus which is caused by increased proliferation and/or reduced apoptosis. the base pair deletion in kv leads to a frame shift and a premature stop codon. the predicted truncated kv protein will retain only the n-terminal domain, the first transmembrane domain and the first extracellular loop. voltage gated potassium channels form a diverse group of membrane proteins, regulating membrane potential, neuronal excitability and nerve signaling. the channels are hetero- or homotetramers, formed by a great variety of subunits, classified in subfamilies. kv belongs to the kv subfamily, consisting of eight members. kv, kv and kv are the most abundant kv subunits expressed in the brain. although the heteromeric structure means that a very large number of k channels can be formed in theory, the composition of the heteromultimers in the mammalian brain seems to be precisely regulated. a direct link between potassium channel dysfunction and apoptosis is that reduced intracellular potassium levels lead to a shift in the balance between pro- and anti-apoptotic signaling pathways. however, a detailed understanding of how this reduction affects the signaling pathways and how it affects the cell is lacking. furthermore, the effect of altered intracellular potassium levels on the potassium channels is unclear. finally, the role of potassium channels in the regulation of apoptosis is not well understood. in the hippocampus, the kv subunit has been reported to be involved in the regulation of apoptosis. it is not known whether kv channels are involved in the regulation of apoptosis in other parts of the brain. the lack of knowledge about the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of altered intracellular potassium levels on apoptosis is due to the complexity of the system, which is difficult to dissect"

38,"The patient receives Heparin infusion after suboccipital craniotomy for resection of the mass. A 73-year-old white man presented to our emergency department with a 3-day history of left lower extremity swelling and acute-onset shortness of breath. On evaluation, he was tachycardic with a pulse of 113, hypertensive with a systolic blood pressure of 130-170 mmHg, and demonstrated poor oxygen saturation of 81% on room air. He was supported with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) and supplemental oxygen while a computed tomography angiogram (CTA) was obtained, which revealed a saddle PE (Fig. ).\nTissue plasminogen activator (tPA) was administered and he was started on a heparin infusion and admitted to our intensive care unit (ICU) for management. He remained on the heparin infusion for 3 days, during which he continuously improved and was eventually weaned to 3 L oxygen via nasal cannula. On hospital day 2, he was transferred to intermediate level of care. Per hematology recommendations, he would have to be on indefinite anticoagulation due to the massive PE he had sustained, the source of which was a left lower extremity popliteal deep vein thrombosis (DVT). The plan was to transition him from the heparin infusion to enoxaparin twice per day with hematology follow-up in 1 month.\nOn the day of discharge, however, he had sudden onset of right leg numbness and weakness below the level of his hip. He had previously been working with physical therapy and had been able to walk 200 feet with the assistance of a walker during each session. A physical examination revealed decreased sensation to light touch, 2/5 strength in right hip flexion and right knee extension and flexion, and loss of right patellar reflex. Left leg physical examination was normal at that time.\nAn emergent head computed tomography (CT) scan was ordered due to concern for a possible stroke, and neurology was consulted. The head CT was negative for infarction or hemorrhage. Neurology was concerned for spinal cord infarction versus hematoma and recommended emergent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of his thoracic and lumbar spine. The MRI revealed a left psoas hematoma (Fig. ). A CT of his pelvis performed the same day also showed a right psoas and iliacus hematoma. Due to these findings, hematology recommended discontinuing enoxaparin and reverting to a low intensity heparin infusion, as well as placement of an inferior vena cava (IVC) filter. The following day his left leg began exhibiting the same symptoms as his right leg. There was concern regarding the risk of progressive and irreversible nerve damage due to compression if the hematomas were not promptly drained. IR was consulted and advised that if the drainage were to occur while our patient was on anticoagulation, the risk of rebleeding into the retroperitoneum would be high and potentially nullify any benefit from drainage. Our patient would also be at risk of hemodynamic instability if the current hematomas were acting as tamponades against further bleeding. An additional complicating factor was the risk of further thrombosis due to the presenting saddle PE. Hematology was consulted for recommendations on pausing anticoagulation, but they were hesitant to offer a timeframe as there was no established safe period to enable this type of procedure to take place. Eventually, a window period of pausing the heparin infusion for 3 hours pre-procedure and up to 6 hours post-procedure was decided upon in the event that our patient agreed to have the drainage performed.\nThroughout this sequence of events, our patient and his wife were aware of the plans and considerations on how to proceed. They were informed of the recommendations and concerns made by neurology, hematology, and IR, as well as the risks and benefits of intervention versus non-intervention.\nAfter speaking with his wife, our patient decided to undergo the procedure. The low intensity heparin infusion was stopped 3 hours beforehand and the IR team then performed drainage of the right retroperitoneal hematoma, placing two pigtail catheters in our patient’s right flank (Fig. ). In total, the hematoma was drained of 215 milliliters of blood, 10 milliliters of which were drained during the procedure itself. The left psoas hematoma was not found to be amenable to drainage.\nOur patient tolerated the procedure well, and the heparin infusion was restarted 6 hours after it was completed. A repeat neurological examination demonstrated improved lower extremity strength bilaterally as well as the return of sensation to light touch. Hip flexion improved to 3/5 bilaterally, and knee flexion and extension improved to 4/5 bilaterally. Deep tendon reflexes remained absent. Four days later, the pigtail catheters were removed. His recovery was complicated by anemia requiring blood transfusions totaling 4 units of packed red blood cells (PRBC). Other sources of potential bleeding were evaluated and not found. A repeat CT on hospital day 10 (Fig. ) showed a stable right-sided hematoma, and our patient did not experience any further neurologic deficits. He was transitioned again from the heparin infusion to enoxaparin after 3 more days. His hemoglobin and hematocrit remained stable. During this time, he worked with physical therapy, who recommended discharge to a skilled nursing facility where his strength began to improve somewhat. Follow-up was scheduled with neurology and hematology. On hospital day 18, he was safely discharged.

In her personal medical history, she had used misoprostol for medical abortion 6 and 3 years previously. There was no history of smoking, alcoholic beverage consumption, or drug abuse during the pregnancy, and no hereditary anomalies were identified in her family.\nA male neonate who weighed 2400 g was born at 34 weeks and 4 days of gestation by cesarean section. His Apgar scores were 10 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes. At birth, we noticed an amniotic band that consisted of a layer of annular amniotic tissue approximately 1 cm wide, which was tightened around the upper third of the right upper limb. The distal limb displayed cyanoderma, edema of the extremity, and focal peeling, with no autonomous activities or reactions of tenderness (). An X-ray showed a negative result for the humerus, but clear swelling of the soft tissues (). During the operation, the space between the amniotic band and upper limb skin was carefully separated and the band was cut off directly. The neonate was then transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit. Four hours later, swelling of the right limb was further aggravated, the radial artery could not be reached, and the local skin color did not improve. Hypoperfusion of the limb was continued and the limb remained insensate without motor compromise ().

The patient had a history of left elbow arthrodesis performed for posttraumatic arthritis at the age of 18. On physical examination he was tender at the proximal ulna. He had no active flexion or extension at his elbow, which was fused at 90 degrees but achieved 40 degrees of pronation and 60 degrees of supination. His motor and sensory exam was normal at the hand. Radiographs of the forearm and the elbow revealed an elbow arthrodesis at 90 degrees with retained hardware and a minimally displaced proximal ulnar shaft fracture (). A decision was made to treat his ulnar shaft fracture closed in a cast, and he subsequently developed a hypertrophic nonunion. At his clinic visit three months after the fall, surgical options for the ulna nonunion were discussed with the patient. We proceeded with conservative treatment for an additional three months, with worsening motion through the nonunion site. He revealed that he was unhappy with the functional limitations of his elbow arthrodesis and inquired about the possibility of converting it to an arthroplasty. The risks of elbow arthroplasty were discussed with the patient at length. Increasing the functional capacity of his arm was his ultimate goal, and understanding that he faced a likely operation for the ulna nonunion, the patient wished to proceed.

While he has clear consciousness, he has never walked, as he was unable to move his arms or legs. Since the age of 8, when he suffered aspiration pneumonia, he been completely bedridden and has been using continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) during sleep.

In a limited manner, the patient was able to voluntarily open his mouth and was able to eat regular food. The patient has been complaining of pain in his TMJ and temporal area during mouth opening for 10 years, which hindered him from receiving treatment for long-term molar pain.\nTherefore, he was referred to undergo general anesthesia for treatment of the molar area. However, we decided to defer general anesthesia due to a high risk of respiratory complications based on his medical history and physical examination, and instead performed local anesthesia of his TMJ area. We determined that the patient had severe pain in the bilateral temporal and TMJ area due to hyperextension of the mouth closing muscle while opening his mouth, and perform local anesthesia to alleviate tension in the TMJ and mouth closing muscle area during dental treatment. At the dental clinic, 1 mL 0.5% levobupivacaine was injected on each side of the TMJ and temporalis fascia before performing oral and maxillofacial surgery (). In approximately 10 minutes, the patient reported feeling no pain while opening his mouth, and oral examination and the required dental treatments were performed while monitoring his oxygen saturation levels.

The patient has been complaining of pain in his TMJ and temporal area during mouth opening for 10 years, which hindered him from receiving treatment for long-term molar pain.\nTherefore, he was referred to undergo general anesthesia for treatment of the molar area. However, we decided to defer general anesthesia due to a high risk of respiratory complications based on his medical history and physical examination, and instead performed local anesthesia of his TMJ area. We determined that the patient had severe pain in the bilateral temporal and TMJ area due to hyperextension of the mouth closing muscle while opening his mouth, and perform local anesthesia to alleviate tension in the TMJ and mouth closing muscle area during dental treatment. At the dental clinic, 1 mL 0.5% levobupivacaine was injected on each side of the TMJ and temporalis fascia before performing oral and maxillofacial surgery (). In approximately 10 minutes, the patient reported feeling no pain while opening his mouth, and oral examination and the required dental treatments were performed while monitoring his oxygen saturation levels. During the examination, his #36, #45, and #46 were found to be severely decayed, and we extracted these teeth after performing local anesthesia. The patient did not show any signs of respiratory distress and was able to open his mouth wide for the rest of the examination and treatment. The patient was discharged from the clinic after the procedure with no complications.\nAlthough there are several reports of the use of local anesthesia in patients with SMA, the case presented here is the first report of its use in a patient with SMA who has never walked. The patient was able to undergo dental treatment without complications, and we believe that the use of local anesthesia was an effective method for alleviating pain in the patient with SMA who was bedridden."

49,"The patient is in good general health. A 77-year-old female presented to the orthopedic hand clinic with a three-year history of an extremely sensitive small mass on her right wrist. The mass had subjectively grown over this period of time. The pain had progressively worsened over time, and she had developed significant hypersensitivity to light contact. There was no complaint of cold sensitivity to the mass. The pain occasionally radiated down the ulnar aspect of her wrist. She had no known history of previous trauma to this area; however, she did have a history of squamous cell carcinoma to the dorsal-radial aspect of that hand. This had been treated previously for which she subsequently developed a reflex sympathetic dystrophy (RSD), resulting in a delayed recovery in the range of motion. A previous stellate ganglion block did not provide relief for her RSD, and her range of motion had been slowly progressing with home exercises.\nOn physical exam, a small round nodule approximately 5 mm x 5 mm was palpable dorsal to the extensor carpi ulnaris and 1 cm proximal to the ulnar styloid. There was significant point tenderness that did not radiate or display a Tinel’s sign. Her imaging included plain films of the affected extremity that showed no abnormality outside of diffuse osteopenia.\nThe location and exam were consistent with a neuroma that had evolved from a cutaneous nerve or possibly from the dorsal sensory branch of the ulnar nerve. The patient was taken to the operative theatre and deep dissection revealed a maroon-colored mass approximately 5 mm x 5 mm, connected to a cutaneous nerve branch.
